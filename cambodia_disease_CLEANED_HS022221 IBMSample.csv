REUTERS/Kham/File Photo  MUMBAI/TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia's chicken farmers are confronting the region's worst bird flu outbreak in years, with the deadly virus affecting farms stretching from Japan to India, roiling some poultry prices and showing no signs of easing.  More than 20 million chickens have been destroyed in South Korea and Japan since November. The highly pathogenic H5N8 virus last week reached India, the world's No. 6 producer, and has already been reported in 10 states.  While bird flu is common in Asia at this time of year due to migratory bird patterns, new strains of the virus have evolved to become more lethal in wild birds, making countries on flight pathways particularly vulnerable, say experts.  Graphic: Countries with bird flu outbreaks -  ""This is one of the worst outbreaks ever in India,""ù said Mohinder Oberoi, an Indian animal health expert and former advisor to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  ""There's a lot of disease in crows and ducks. People are scared of the disease in crows. They know they fly far and think they'll infect their poultry or even people.""ù  The Asian outbreak comes as Europe suffers its worst bird flu outbreak in years, and follows on the heels of COVID-19, which hurt poultry sales early on in some places amid false disease concerns but is now driving up demand due to more home cooking.  Graphic: Total outbreaks of avian flu by country and region -  Chicken prices in India fell almost a third last week as wary consumers, increasingly nervous about disease since the pandemic, steered clear of the meat.  Bird flu cannot infect people through poultry consumption, and the H5N8 virus is not known to have ever infected humans, but consumers are still fearful, said Uddhav Ahire, chairman of Anand Agro Group, a poultry company based in the western city of Nashik.  Live chicken prices are already as low as 58 Indian rupees ($0.79) a kilogram, below the cost of production, he said.  In South Korea and Japan, no market impact has been seen yet, officials said, with stronger demand for chicken meat for home cooked meals during lockdowns having a greater effect on prices.  VIRUS EVOLUTION  The rapid and wide geographic spread of the latest outbreaks make this one of the worst waves in Asia since the early 2000s.  In Japan, where outbreaks have been reported from Chiba near Tokyo to more than 1,000 km (620 miles) away in Miyazaki on Kyushu island in just two months, fresh cases are still occurring.  ""We can't say risk of the further spread of bird flu has diminished as the migration season for wild birds will continue till March, or even April in some cases,""ù said an animal health official in the agriculture ministry.  Graphic: Japan's birdflu outbreak by prefecture -  The H5N8 viruses detected in Japan and Korea are very similar to those that spread through Europe in 2019, which in turn evolved from viruses that were prevalent in 2014, said Filip Claes, head of the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD).  A different variant circulating in Europe since late 2020 is also causing significant damage.  The new strains are causing more harm now they are more lethal in wild birds, said Holly Shelton, influenza expert at Britain's Pirbright Institute.  ""It's quite clear that this virus has established itself in the wild bird population and so now there's a greater propensity for it to spill over back into poultry farms,""ù she said.  Graphic: Global chicken meat production -  A compulsory flu vaccination for poultry in China has protected the region's top producer, even though the virus has killed wild swans there.  Indonesia, Asia's No.2 producer, is only a temporary transit point for wild birds, reducing its risk of infection, said Fadjar Sumping Tjatur Rassa, director of animal health at the Agriculture Ministry.  Still, the country has banned live bird imports from countries with H5N8 and set up a surveillance system for early detection of the virus, he said.  With no major bird flight pathways over Southeast Asia, countries like Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have so far been spared H5N8 outbreaks, but face risks from the movement of people and goods.  ""It will keep spreading until another virus comes along to replace it,""ù said Shelton.",influenza,Which Asian countries are experiencing a bird flu outbreak?,"South Korea, Japan, India, ",Wich Asian countries are less vulnerable to bird flu outbreaks?,"Viertman, Laos, and Cambodia",Which type of bird flu has been detected?,H5N8,,

However, challenges remain in eliminating HIV infections in key populations, including women working in entertainment establishments, such as massage parlors, karaoke bars, or beer gardens. This study explored the prevalence of HIV and identified factors associated with HIV infection among female entertainment workers (FEWs) in Cambodia. Methods This national biological and behavioral survey was conducted in 2016 in Phnom Penh and 17 provinces. We used a two-stage cluster sampling method to recruit FEWs for HIV testing performed on-site and face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. We investigated factors associated with HIV infection using multiple logistic regression. Results This study included 3149 FEWs with a mean age of 26.2 years (SD 5.7). The adjusted prevalence of HIV was 3.2% (95% CI 1.76""ì5.75). In the multiple logistic regression model, the odds of HIV infection were significantly higher among FEWs in the age group of 31 to 35 (AOR 2.72, 95% CI 1.36""ì8.25) and 36 or older (AOR 3.62, 95% CI 1.89""ì10.55); FEWs who were not married but living with a sexual partner (AOR 3.00, 95% CI 1.16""ì7.79); FEWs who had at least ten years of formal education (AOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17""ì0.83); FEWs who reported having abnormal vaginal discharge (AOR 3.51, 95% CI 1.12""ì9.01), genital ulcers or sores (AOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.09""ì3.17), and genital warts (AOR 2.89, 95% CI 1.44""ì6.33) in the past three months; and FEWs who reported using illicit drugs (AOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.20""ì4.27) than their respective reference group. The odds of HIV infection were significantly lower among FEWs working in karaoke bars (AOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14""ì0.50) and beer gardens (AOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09""ì0.54) than among freelance FEWs. Conclusions The prevalence of HIV among FEWs in Cambodia remains much higher than that in the general population. These findings indicate that differentiated strategies to address HIV and other sexually transmitted infections should be geared towards FEWs working as freelancers or in veiled entertainment venues such as massage parlors and freelance sex workers. Prevention efforts among venue-based FEWs should be sustained.

Introduction The national response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Cambodia has been described as tri-phasic [1]. In the first phase (1991""ì2000), Cambodia faced one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in Asia; and in 1998, the HIV prevalence peaked at 1.7% among the general adult population aged 15 to 49 [2, 3]. The second phase (2001 to 2010) was characterized by combined efforts related to treatment, decentralization of services, and enhanced focus on key populations [4]. As a result of these strategies, the epidemic was significantly controlled. In recognition of the national success in controlling the HIV epidemic, Cambodia was feted with the United Nations' Millennium Development Goal award in 2010 [5, 6]. The current third phase (2011""ì2020) aims to achieve three-zero targets: (1) zero new HIV infection, (2) zero AIDS-related death, and (3) zero AIDS-related discrimination in communities [4]. Initial evidence suggests that the HIV epidemic is on a downward trajectory, and the HIV prevalence in the general adult population aged 15 to 49 declined to 0.6% in 2016 [7]. Due to the expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), annual AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by two-thirds over the past ten years [1, 8]. Despite these tremendous successes, Cambodia has faced significant challenges in controlling the HIV epidemic in key populations, including female entertainment workers (FEWs). In Cambodia, FEWs refer to women working in entertainment establishments such as karaoke bars, massage parlors, or beer gardens. FEWs working in these establishments may or may not be involved in transactional sex. The FEW population also includes freelance sex workers who solicit clients in public places, such as streets or parks, or on calls. In 2008, the Cambodian government enacted a new Law to Suppress Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation [9], which has made health interventions in sites used for transactional sex more difficult. Due to the closure of many brothels, sex work has moved to entertainment-based venues or other informal and hidden settings like streets and parks. The distinction between direct and indirect sex work has become obscured, and an increase in indirect transactional relationships, such as sweethearts, have been documented [10]. In the Cambodian context, ""sweethearts""ù refer to romantic non-commercial sexual relationships. For FEWs, a sweetheart is typically a boyfriend or regular client in the form of indirect transactional sex through living support, dinner dates, gifts, or shopping trips. Such relationships usually involve a lack of condom use as displays of trust and intimacy [11]. Among FEWs, the HIV prevalence is exceptionally high in sub-groups such as brothel-based (17.4%) and street-based (37.3%) sex workers than among women working in other entertainment establishments (9.8%) [7]. Couture et al. conducted a prospective study of young FEWs in the capital city of Phnom Penh and found that the HIV incidence among the FEWs was 3.6 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2%""ì11.1%) [12]. The identified risk factors of the HIV infection in the study included being freelance sex workers and younger age of first sex (‚â§15 years). Our recent study found that almost half of the FEW participants had not tested for HIV in the past six months preceding the survey [11]. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), substance use, mental health problems, and gender-based violence were also commonly reported among FEWs in Cambodia [12""ì20], while the rates of consistent condom use remain consistently low [11, 21]. These conditions and behaviors have been reported as risk factors of HIV infection and HIV risk behaviors among this key population [12""ì17]. Collectively, these empirical data suggest that FEWs in Cambodia remain at disproportionally high risk of HIV infection. Due to the significant changes in the sex and entertainment industry landscapes, the information on the burden of HIV infection and its related risk factors needs to be closely followed up. The strategic information with up-to-date data on the HIV epidemic and programmatic response is crucial to Cambodia, particularly in the wake of the shrinking international HIV funding. The reduced funding is due to the country's status change from a low-income to a lower-middle-income country in 2016 [22]. More strategic decisions need to be made to adapt to the limited resources to achieve the ambitious global targets of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the HIV prevalence and identify risk factors associated with HIV infection among FEWs in Cambodia.  Materials and methods Study sites and participants This National Integrated Biological and Behavioral Survey among FEWs (FEW-IBBS) was conducted in 2016 in Phnom Penh and 17 other provinces purposively selected out of the 25 provinces in Cambodia. The FEW population size in the selected provinces represented more than 90% of the total FEWs in Cambodia in 2015 [7, 23]. The survey included women who were (1) working in the entertainment establishments or as freelance sex workers; (2) aged at least 18 years; (3) sexually active, defined as having had vaginal or anal sexual intercourse with at least one man in the past 12 months; (4) able to communicate in Khmer; (5) able and willing to provide written informed consent; and (6) willing to be physically present at the study site for an interview and HIV testing. Sample size calculation We used the Open Epi calculator version 3.02 [24] to calculate the sample size required to estimate the HIV prevalence. In 2016, the estimated total number of FEWs in Cambodia was 40215, working in 2571 entertainment establishments, including 896 freelance FEWs [3, 7]. Using the HIV prevalence of 3.1% in the most recent national survey [23], a design effect of 1.5, 10% refusal rate, and a 95% confidence level, the minimum sample size required for the survey was 3100 FEWs. Sampling procedures Venue-based FEWs were sampled using a multi-stage cluster sampling design. First, we listed all the entertainment establishments clusters (karaoke bars, massage parlors, beer gardens, and beer companies) in the selected areas and the estimated number of FEWs in each cluster. Next, we assigned a number to each cluster. We used a random number calculator to randomly select a cluster from the list. Subsequently, we invited all the FEWs in the selected clusters to partake in the study. We repeated the random cluster selection until the target sample size was attained. We used a time-location sampling method to recruit freelance FEWs. We established a sampling frame comprised of all known hotspots where freelance FEWs were known to assemble using information obtained from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working with this population in the different localities. Before data collection, the study team worked closely with the respective NGOs to conduct a feasibility assessment and updated the sampling frame accordingly. We randomly selected the locations, date, and time (in four-hour time periods) for participant recruitment. We anticipated that the number of hotspots in each province would be small. Therefore, we included all hotspots and invited all FEWs found at the hotspots to participate in the study. Data collection training In this national survey, we involved representatives of key stakeholders, including FEW communities, in every stage of the survey, from study design to questionnaire development and validation, data collection, and finding dissemination. Pre-data-collection workshops and training were conducted with data collection teams and representatives of HIV key stakeholders, NGOs working with FEWs, and FEW communities. Data collection teams were composed of team leaders from the Surveillance Unit of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and STD, staff members of the respective provincial health department, and representatives of NGOs, community outreach workers, and FEW communities. The training covered: (1) sampling methods, including mapping and eligibility criteria, (2) informed consent procedures, (3) participants' privacy and confidentiality, (4) study protocol and interview techniques, (5) blood specimen collection, and (6) record-keeping and completion of the survey forms. We also pretested the questionnaire during the training. Questionnaire development We developed a structured questionnaire for face-to-face interviews, which took approximately 30 minutes to complete. Standardized and validated tools were adapted from previous studies among HIV key populations in Cambodia [18""ì20, 25, 26]. The structured questionnaire was initially developed in English and then translated into Khmer, Cambodia's national language. It was then back-translated into English by another translator to ensure that the original items' ""content and spirit""ù were maintained. A consultative meeting was held with representatives of key stakeholders working on HIV and harm reduction programs, including NGOs and FEW communities, to review the study protocol and tools. A pilot study was conducted with 20 FEWs in Phnom Penh, later excluded from the main study. Variables and measurements Socio-demographic characteristics included age (continuous), urbanicity of study sites, marital status, years of formal education attained (continuous), and type of entertainment venue for which the woman was working. We also collected information on living duration in the current city (continuous) and working duration in the current entertainment venue (continuous). For HIV risks, we collected information regarding the participant's HIV status and sexual behaviors with commercial partners, defined as having sexual intercourse in exchange for money or gifts, and non-commercial partners. These included the number of sexual partners (continuous), condom use frequency (always, frequently, sometimes, never), STI diagnosis, and experiences of STI symptoms (yes or no) in the past three months. We also collected information on illicit drug use (heroin, marijuana, amphetamine-type stimulants, or other types of drugs) and alcoholic drinks at work (yes or no) in the past three months. For participants who reported living with HIV, we collected self-reported HIV care and treatment information, including ART. All participants received HIV testing regardless of whether they already knew their HIV-status. A blood sample was obtained from each participant by a trained laboratory technician through finger-prick and tested for HIV antibodies using the HIV-1/2 Determine‚Ñ¢ test, following the national protocol [27]. We confirmed the test results by the HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK‚Ñ¢ test on-site. If a specimen was reactive by the HIV-1/2 Determine‚Ñ¢ test but non-reactive by the HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK‚Ñ¢ test, the participant was recommended to go for a confirmatory test at an ART clinic of their choice with support from a community outreach worker. HIV test result was provided to the participants verbally after the interview, together with post-test counseling. All participants attended a pre- and post-test counseling session provided by trained counselors from HIV confidential counseling and testing centers located in the study sites. Those tested positive for HIV were referred to an ART clinic of their choice by a local NGO working in the respective area for care and treatment services according to the national guidelines. All participants received a token of appreciation valued at approximately US$4 for their time and effort. Statistical analyses Sampling weights that corrected for non-response and sample design were applied. Standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the venue level [28]. We calculated the HIV prevalence by dividing the number of HIV-positive participants by the total number of participants tested. In bivariate analyses, we used the Chi-squared test (or Fisher's exact test when a cell count was smaller than five) for categorical variables and Student's t-test for continuous variables. A multiple logistic regression model was built to identify risk factors associated with HIV infection. We transformed the age and education level into categorical variables. We included age, education level, marital status, types of entertainment establishments, and other variables significantly associated with HIV infection in bivariate analyses (p<0.05) simultaneously in the model. We then removed variables not statistically significant from the model using a backward stepwise selection method. We reported adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with its associated 95% CI and p-values. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp, Texas, United States). Ethical considerations The National Ethics Committee for Health Research, Ministry of Health, Cambodia approved the study (Ref no: 297NECHR). The data collection team explained to the participants about the study and obtained their written consent. Participation in the study was voluntary, and participants could refuse to respond to any questions or discontinue their participation at any time. We also extended free HIV testing to eligible individuals who refused to participate in this study if they wanted. We maintained the confidentiality of the participants by using unique codes, and no personal identifiers were recorded.  Results HIV prevalence and socio-demographic characteristics Of 3353 FEWs invited, 148 (4.4%) refused to participate in the study, primarily due to their time constraints. Fifty-six participants (1.8%) with missing data of main variables or HIV testing results were further excluded from the analyses. In total, we included 3149 FEWs in the analyses. The mean age of the participants was 26.2 years (SD 5.7). The adjusted HIV prevalence among FEWs in this study was 3.2%. The prevalence was 11.1% among freelance FEWs (11.1%) and 4.3% among FEWs working in massage parlors. Of those who knew their HIV-positive status (n = 29), 86.2% were on ART. As shown in Table 1, most of the participants were aged 30 or younger, and 38.6% were divorced or widowed. The participants' education level was generally low, with 60.1% having attained six years or less of formal education. More than two-thirds (70.6%) worked in karaoke bars, and 43.9% reported having worked in the current venue for more than one year. HIV infection was significantly associated with age groups, marital status, formal education level, entertainment venue type, and working duration in the current entertainment venue.

Socio-demographic characteristics of HIV-positive and HIV-negative FEWs (n = 3149). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244357.t001 HIV risk behaviors Table 2 shows that 24.9% of women reported always using condoms with non-commercial partners in the past three months. Of the 1396 (53.0%) women who reported having sexual intercourse in exchange for money or gifts in the past 12 months, 19.5% reported having two or more commercial partners on the last working day, and 80.5% reported always using condoms with this type of partners in the past three months. Regarding substance use, 7.7% reported using illicit drugs in the past three months, with amphetamine-type stimulants being the most commonly used drugs. About two-thirds (62.6%) reported drinking alcohol at work every day, and 80.8% reported having five or more alcoholic drinks on their last working day. About one in five (20.2%) reported having been diagnosed with an STI in the past three months. The most common facilities where the participants received the STI diagnosis were public health facilities (55.4%) and NGOs' clinics (34.7%). The participants also reported different forms of STI symptoms experienced in the past three months, including abnormal vaginal discharge (33.9%), lower abdominal pain (25.8%), ulcers or sores in genital areas (2.5%), and genital warts (1.3%). HIV infection was significantly associated with consistent condom use levels with non-commercial partners, involvement in transactional sex, the number of commercial sex partners, and forced sex and gang-rape experience. HIV infection was also significantly associated with STI diagnosis and symptoms and substance use, including illicit drug use, alcohol use, and binge drinking.

After controlling for other covariates, the odds of HIV infection were significantly higher among FEWs in the age group of 31 to 35 (AOR 2.72, 95% CI 1.36""ì8.25) and 36 or older (AOR 3.62, 95% CI 1.89""ì10.55) than those in the age group of <21 years.

The odds of HIV infection were significantly lower among FEWs who had attained at least ten years of formal education than those attaining ‚â§six years of formal education (AOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17""ì0.83). Compared to freelance FEWs, the odds of HIV infection were significantly lower among FEWs working at karaoke bars (AOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14""ì0.50) and beer gardens (AOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09""ì0.54). The odds of HIV infection were significantly higher among FEWs who reported having abnormal vaginal discharge (AOR 3.51, 95% CI 1.12""ì9.01), genital ulcers or sores (AOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.09""ì3.17), and genital warts (AOR 2.89, 95% CI 1.44""ì6.33) in the past three months than those who did not. The odds of HIV infection were also significantly higher among FEWs who reported using illicit drugs (AOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.20""ì4.27) than those who did not.

Factors associated with HIV infection among female entertainment workers (n = 3149). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244357.t003  Discussion We found that the HIV prevalence among FEWs in this national survey was 3.2%, about six times higher than the estimated 0.6% prevalence among the Cambodian general population [4] and 0.3% among Cambodian pregnant women attending antenatal care in the same year [7]. This study also identified several risk factors associated with HIV infection among FEWs in this national survey. Our results showed that the risk of HIV infection increased significantly with age and was associated with the nature of entertainment venues where FEWs were working. The prevalence was also significantly higher among FEWs with histories of illicit drug use and STI diagnosis and symptoms such as genital warts, genital ulcers or sores, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The risk of HIV infection was inversely associated with years of formal education attained. We found that the HIV prevalence was exceptionally high among specific subgroups of FEWs, such as freelance FEWs (11.1%) and FEWs working in massage parlors (4.3%). Past surveys have also indicated a high HIV prevalence among various groups of FEWs, such as brothel-based (17.4%) and street-based (37.3%) sex workers, as compared to the prevalence among women working in other entertainment establishments (9.8%) [12]. In the absence of a safer working environment such as brothels [12, 17, 29], our findings suggest that differentiated programming is needed to ensure that HIV prevention efforts are intensified, particularly for street-based and freelance FEWs. The higher prevalence of HIV among FEWs in the older age groups found in this study is in line with findings from another study that reported a similar relationship between HIV infection and older FEWs in Cambodia [30]. The cumulative exposure to HIV risks could explain this association. Previous studies in Cambodia also suggested that street-based FEWs tend to be older than women working in brothels and entertainment venues [12, 14, 17]. In this study, most HIV positive cases detected in the older age groups (>30 years) were aware of their HIV status before the survey. This study found that FEWs who were not married but living with their partners were at a higher risk of HIV. We also observed a similar trend among FEWs who were married but not living with their partners. This observation is consistent with findings from previous studies in Cambodia, which showed low rates of consistent condom use in non-commercial relationships among FEWs [11, 19, 20]. In our recent study, unprotected sex was reported by FEWs to be a way to express trust and faithfulness to their regular non-commercial partners (sweethearts) [11, 19]. Together, these findings may explain the higher risk of HIV among non-married FEWs living with partners. Given the consistency of this observation, new strategies to increase consistent condom use among FEWs are warranted. Besides, our results indicated that the risk of HIV was higher among FEWs who reported illicit drug use. This finding could be attributed to the negative impact of illicit drug use on consistent condom use, numbers of sex partners, or unsafe injection practices [12, 31""ì33]. Furthermore, our study found that the presence of STI symptoms was associated with HIV infection, and it is consistent with other evidence regarding the relationship between STIs and HIV infection [12, 16]. The high prevalence of STI symptoms observed in our study is congruous with findings from other studies conducted among FEWs in Cambodia [11, 12, 14, 19]. These results suggested that tailored education efforts should be implemented, emphasizing regular condom use, condom negotiation skills, and the detrimental effects of alcohol and other substance use on HIV exposure. Risk-reduction education is crucial, given that the prevalence of HIV was higher among less educated FEWs. Strengths and limitations The strengths of this study include the implementation of multi-stage sampling procedures to engage a large sample of FEWs across sites with a high burden of HIV in Cambodia. We used standardized data collection procedures and validated tools to collect biological samples and survey data across all study sites. Furthermore, this survey involved pertinent stakeholders at different national health system levels, NGOs, and community members in developing the study protocol, tools, and strategies for disseminating study findings. Despite these strengths, this study also has several limitations. First, this study did not include seven provinces with a lower burden of HIV and a smaller FEW population. Therefore, the study findings may not be generalized to a national level, although the data were appropriately weighted in the analyses. Second, we collected data on sensitive issues such as sexual behaviors using self-reported measures through face-to-face interviews that may result in potential social desirability bias. The risks are likely to be underestimated, given the cultural norms governing sexual behaviors and substance use in Cambodia. Third, albeit minimal, the monetary incentive given to the participants and their connection to the ongoing community-based HIV programs may have affected their genuine motivation to partake in the study and potentially influenced their response to the survey. Nevertheless, we believe that we took sufficient measures to minimize these potential effects throughout the data collection. Finally, we could not meet the sample size requirement for freelance FEWs due to difficulty reaching this population. Therefore, generalizability to the entire population of freelance FEWs could be limited.  Conclusions This study documents the prevalence and risk factors of HIV infection among FEWs in Cambodia. The results showed that the HIV infection risk was associated with older age, the nature of the entertainment venues where FEWs were working, and history of illicit drug use and STI symptoms in the past three months. The risk of HIV infection was inversely associated with years of formal education attained. These findings indicate that differentiated strategies for HIV prevention among FEWs should be geared towards the FEWs working as freelancers or in veiled entertainment venues, such as massage parlors, and freelance FEWs. However, prevention efforts for venue-based FEWs should be maintained. Innovative interventions such as online services and mobile health technologies using text and voice messaging may be more useful than the current reliance on physical outreach activities to effectively reach freelance and other high-risk FEWs for early HIV detection and linking them to treatment and care services.

Because of high transmission of","Abstract Malaria continues to impose a significant health burden in the continent of Africa with 213 million cases in 2018 alone, representing 93% of cases worldwide. Because of high transmission of malaria within the continent, the selection pressures to develop drug resistance in African parasites are distinct compared to the rest of the world. In light of the spread of resistance to artemisinin conferred by the C580Y mutation in the PfKelch13 propeller domain in Southeast Asia, and its independent emergence in South America, it is important to study genetic determinants of resistance in the African context using African parasites. Through in vitro evolution of Senegalese parasites, we had previously generated the artemisinin-resistant parasites Pikine_R and Thi√®s_R and established pfcoronin mutations to be sufficient to confer artemisinin resistance in the standard ring-stage survival assay (RSA). In the current study, we used genetic analysis of revertants to demonstrate pfcoronin to be the major driver of elevated RSA in the artemisinin-resistant parasites Pikine_R and Thi√®s_R evolved in vitro. We interrogated the role of a second gene PF3D7_1433800, which also had mutations in both the Pikine_R and Thi√®s_R selected lines, but found no evidence of a contribution to reduced susceptibility in the RSA survival assay. Nevertheless, our genetic analysis demonstrates that parasite genetic background is important in the level of pfcoronin mediated RSA survival, and therefore we cannot rule out a role for PF3D7_1433800 in other genetic backgrounds. Finally, we tested the potential synergy between the mutations of pfcoronin and pfkelch13 through the generation of single and double mutants in the Pikine genetic background and found that the contribution of pfcoronin to reduced susceptibility is masked by the presence of pfkelch13. This phenomenon was also observed in the 3D7 background, suggesting that pfcoronin may mediate its effects via the same pathway as pfkelch13. Investigating the biology of proteins containing the beta-propeller domain could further elucidate the different pathways that the parasite could use to attain resistance.  Author summary Artemisinin-based combination therapies remain a crucial standard treatment in combatting malaria around the world. Given the independent emergence of artemisinin resistance associated with pfkelch13 mutations in Southeast Asia and South America, it is important to study genetic determinants in the African context. Previously, we had generated artemisinin-resistant parasites, referred to as Pikine_R and Thi√®s_R, by subjecting clinical isolates of parasites from Senegal to artemisinin drug pressure in the laboratory. We found that mutations in the pfcoronin gene are sufficient to result in resistance in a standard laboratory assay. Here we report that pfcoronin mutations are also necessary for the level of artemisinin resistance observed in both Pikine_R and Thi√®s_R. In diverse parasite strains the level of resistance is also sensitive to genetic background. Genetic analysis revealed that the resistance phenotype of pfkelch13 alone masks any additional contribution from pfcoronin. Future studies should focus on investigating pfcoronin biology.

Although significant reductions in disease burden have been achieved since the adoption of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) in the early 2000s, the greatest burden of malaria, primarily caused by Plasmodium falciparum, continues to occur on the African continent [1]. However, artemisinin drug resistance has emerged in Southeast Asia [2] that is attributed to mutations in the propeller domain of the Kelch13 protein of P. falciparum (PfKelch13). The C580Y mutation in particular, which is approaching fixation in Southeast Asia [3], has recently been reported to have independently emerged in South America [4] and Papua New Guinea [5], threatening the success achieved by ACTs. ACTs largely remain effective in the African continent, despite recent reports of pfkelch13 mutations in Rwanda [6] and Tanzania [7]. Several reports of resistance occurring independently of pfkelch13, suggest more than one genetic pathway for resistance [8""ì10]. Given that the PfKelch13 C580Y mutation has now been linked to a slowdown of the endocytic machinery for hemoglobin uptake [11], it has yet to be determined if all the different genetic pathways of resistance converge in reducing the uptake of hemoglobin. The prevalence of malaria, level of immunity, and complexity of infection are very different in the low-transmission setting of Southeast Asia as compared with the African continent. Since Africa has the highest disease burden of P. falciparum malaria, the selection pressures on African parasites are markedly different from those in Southeast Asia [12,13]. Mutations in AP2 mu, encoding the AP-2 complex subunit mu [14], and ubp1, encoding the ubiquitin hydrolase, have been linked to artemisinin resistance only in parasites with African genetic backgrounds [9,15]. This observation implies that mechanistic studies of artemisinin resistance should include parasites from different parts of the African continent. Our interest is therefore in understanding artemisinin resistance in African parasites. Using in vitro evolution of resistance, coupled with next generation whole genome sequencing, we previously identified two genes (PF3D7_1251200 pfcoronin and PF3D7_1433800 conserved plasmodium protein of unknown function [16]) that had mutations in both the independently selected resistant parasites Pikine_R and Thi√®s_R [17]. No mutations in pfkelch13 were detected. Mutations in pfcoronin G50E (in Thi√®s_R) and R100K & E107V (in Pikine_R) were of special interest because of the structural similarity of the WD-40 beta-propeller domain of the actin-bundling protein PfCoronin to the beta-propeller domain of PfKelch13, the known marker of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia [2]. Through CRISPR-Cas9 mediated introduction of pfcoronin mutations into their respective parental wildtype genetic backgrounds, we established that the PfCoronin mutations are sufficient to confer reduced artemisinin susceptibility as measured by the gold-standard ring-stage survival assay (RSA) [17]. In the work presented here, we further analyzed the role of pfcoronin in conferring reduced artemisinin sensitivity in the in vitro evolved parasites Thi√®s_R and Pikine_R. We also studied the role of genetic background in resistance using the standard laboratory strain 3D7. In addition, we investigated the contribution of mutations in PF3D7_1433800, which encodes a conserved Plasmodium protein of unknown function, and we examined potential phenotypic synergy between pfcoronin and pfkelch13 mutations.  Discussion In this study, we established that mutations in pfcoronin are the major drivers of reduced artemisinin sensitivity in our in vitro evolved Senegalese parasite lines Thi√®s_R and Pikine_R. When mutations in pfcoronin were reverted back to the wildtype in both Thi√®s_R and Pikine_R, we observed significantly reduced parasite survival in the ring-stage survival assay (RSA) in both genetic backgrounds (Fig 1). This supports our previously published observation of a gain of function associated with the introduction of pfcoronin mutations into wildtype parasites [17]. The resistance contribution of pfcoronin mutations was dependent on parasite genetic background, consistent with observations made with pfkelch13 [18]. Although mutations R100K and E107V were sufficient to surpass the 1% threshold of resistance in RSA (Fig 2), the level of resistance for pfcoronin mutants was much higher in Senegalese parasites [17] than in the 3D7 laboratory strain. We found no evidence of resistance contribution for mutations in the only other gene, PF3D7_1433800, commonly found in the in vitro evolved artemisinin resistant parasites (Fig 3). Upon comparison of naturally occurring polymorphisms of this gene and pfcoronin, PF3D7_1433800 was found to be highly polymorphic with 361 non-synonymous mutations found throughout the African region and Southeast Asia (S5 Table). Further work in other African genetic backgrounds will be needed to confirm the lack of a contribution of this gene by itself or in combination with pfcoronin mutations. Taken together, our work suggests that mutations in pfcoronin are both necessary and sufficient for in vitro artemisinin resistance in Pikine_R and Thi√®s_R, making them the major driver of artemisinin resistance in vitro. We investigated the potential interaction between the mutations in PfCoronin (R100K and E107V) and PfKelch13 (C580Y) through studies of single and double mutants in both Pikine and 3D7 genetic backgrounds. There was a lack of synergy between the mutations of PfCoronin and PfKelch13 (Fig 4). In fact, the pfcoronin gene was found to be masked by pfkelch13. The level of resistance was much higher in the contemporary African parasites compared to laboratory strain 3D7 also of African ancestry, emphasizing the importance of studying genetic factors present using recent clinical isolates. Any potential interaction between pfcoronin and pfkelch13 needs further examination, especially in the African parasites. The C580Y mutation has recently been linked to reduced expression of PfKelch13 protein [11,25], resulting in a slowdown of the endocytic machinery for hemoglobin uptake from the host cell without affecting binding interactions of the protein [11]. The artemisinin-resistance phenotype that we observe with PfCoronin could also result from differences in the level of functional protein in the mutants compared to the wildtype. We plan to explore this in the future alongside binding partner interactions of PfCoronin mutants. Considering the role of actin in endocytosis in Plasmodium as well as higher eukaryotes [26""ì28], PfCoronin mediated actin-bundling could be connected to endocytosis mediated artemisinin resistance. Although the resistance mutations are on the opposite side of the putative actin bundling sites (Fig 5), we cannot rule out the potential involvement of the mutations in impairing or aiding actin bundling, which is the major known function of PfCoronin [23,24,29]. It is noteworthy that T. gondii Coronin has a role in endocytosis and membrane recycling, a process crucial in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, independent of its function in actin bundling [24]. This function remains unexplored in P. falciparum and might suggest an involvement of PfCoronin in the endocytic machinery to attain artemisinin resistance similar to PfKelch13 without involving actin bundling [11]. WD-40 beta-propeller domains, which are understudied in apicomplexans, are conserved protein structures in eukaryotes that support a wide range of cellular functions [30""ì33], similar to the beta-propeller domains found in Kelch-like proteins [34]. We still do not know the exact function of PfKelch13 despite its implication in the ring-stage endocytosis machinery [11], nor do we understand the biological mechanism of artemisinin resistance mediated by PfCoronin. Although widespread resistance-conferring mutations in pfkelch13 are yet to be reported on the African continent, our in vitro work shows that C580Y parasites in the Pikine genetic background exhibit substantial survival in the RSA similar to the Cambodian isolates [2,18,35]. This is unlike Tanzanian F32 parasites which had much lower RSA survival with M476I pfkelch13 and FCB with C580Y pfkelch13 [18], raising additional concerns that West African expressing variants of pfcoronin and/or pfkelch13 could be competitive in the field. This emphasizes the need to gather RSA survival estimates for contemporary African parasites. Investigating the biology of beta propeller domain-containing proteins and the possible genetic interactions between different players in artemisinin resistance could further elucidate mechanisms of resistance.  Methods In vitro parasite culture All laboratory strains [3D7 (MR4)], culture-adapted field isolates from Thi√®s (SenTh032.09) and Pikine (SenP019.04), previously published DHA selected lines Thi√®s_R and Pikine_R [17], and the subsequently generated CRISPR parasite lines were cultured in O+ red blood cells (RBC) (Interstate Blood Bank (IBB), Memphis, TN) with complete RPMI1640 media (Gibco, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% O+ serum (IBB). Parasites were placed in a modular incubator and gassed with 1% O 2 /5% CO 2 /94% N 2 mixture before incubating at 37¬∞C. RSA (Ring-stage Survival Assay) RSA was performed as described previously [2,35] using 0""ì3 hour post reinvasion rings that were highly synchronized and exposed to 700 nM DHA or DMSO for 6 hours. Rings were synchronized with 5% D-sorbitol treatment. At 66 hours after the drug washout, parasitemia was assessed by Giemsa-stained smear microscopy of thin smears. The RSA survival percentage was calculated by dividing the parasitemia in DHA-treated parasites over the DMSO-treated control parasitemia. A minimum of two to three biological replicates of RSA were conducted for each parasite line with two technical replicates per biological replicate. Smears were blinded and at least 10,000 RBC counted per replicate. Drug sensitivity assays with SYBR Green I Drug sensitivity assays were performed as previously described [36]. Briefly, ring-stage parasites were grown to 0.8""ì1% parasitemia in 2% hematocrit in 40ŒºL total volume in 384-well plates. Parasite growth was determined by SYBR Green I staining (Lonza, Visp, Switzerland) of parasite DNA in the trophozoite stage, usually 72 hours after plating. For parasites that grew slowly (double mutants of pfcoronin and pfkelch13 in Pikine background), parasites were stained after 96 hours in culture. The dose-response curves for standard anti-malarial drugs (DHA, ART, MQ; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were generated from a 12-point dilution series of drugs, carried out in triplicate, centered on expected EC 50 reported in the literature; with three biological replicates performed for each drug. A SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) plate reader was used to measure fluorescence, and data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). EC 50 was calculated using nonlinear regression with the log(inhibitor) vs. response with a four-parameter variable slope curve-fitting equation. Gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 Guide sequences targeting the loci of interest were designed using the online tool available via benchling.com. For introducing pfcoronin mutations in 3D7 background, we used the strategy successfully implemented previously in Pikine and Thi√®s parasite backgrounds [17]. For reverting pfcoronin G50E, gRNA containing the mutation was used (S1 Fig). We used previously published strategies for reverting pfcoronin R100K and E107V, including the gRNA 1 sequence (S2 Fig). All gRNAs were individually annealed and ligated into the BbsI digested pDC2-Cas9-U6-hDHFR plasmid, generously provided by Marcus Lee (Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK), or the pUF1Cas9-U6-DHODH generated using the Cas9 plasmid generated previously [20], both of which contain the U6 snRNA polymerase III promoter and regions for the expression of Cas9 enzyme and human DHFR or yeast DHODH drug selection cassette as described previously [37,38]. For generating pfkelch13 C580Y mutants, previous constructs [20] were used for the 3D7 background. After several failed transfection attempts with these constructs in the Pikine background, the same gRNA was annealed and ligated into pUF1Cas9-U6-DHODH. Homology regions of about 500bp containing either the SNP of interest or wildtype sequence (Primers used in S6 Table) were cloned into Zeroblunt TOPO vector (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Quickchange II mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to scramble guide targeting sequence with shield mutations in the homology region. For C580Y homology region for Pikine background, 500bp homology with SNP and shield mutations was amplified from the construct described previously [20]. Transfection was performed on 5""ì8% sorbitol synchronized rings from 3D7, SenTh032.09.13.1 (Thi√®s_R), Sen P019.04 (Pikine wildtype) or SenP019.04.13.1 (Pikine_R) parasites with 50Œºg of Cas9 plasmid and 50Œºg of plasmid containing the homology region using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 0.31 kV and 960 ŒºF as described previously [39]. After the transfection, RBCs were plated at 5% hematocrit in complete media. Transfected parasites were allowed to recover for either 8 hours (for 3D7) or overnight (for Senegalese parasite backgrounds) before the addition of 5 nM WR99210 (for pDC2-Cas9-U6-hDHFR plasmid) (Jacobus Pharmaceutical, NJ) or 500nM DSM1 (for pUF1-Cas9-U6-yDHODH plasmid) (Millipore Sigma, Germany). Drug selection was continued for 96 hours for all but the pfkelch13 mutant generation in Pikine background. For C580Y transfections in Pikine background, drug selection was continued for three weeks. For all transfections, parasite recovery was monitored by microscopy twice a week. Once parasitemia was more than 1%, the loci of interests were genotyped by Sanger sequencing performed by either Psomagen USA (Cambridge, MA) or Genewiz (Cambridge, MA) using the bulk transfectant gDNA. After confirming successful transfection, dilutional cloning was performed in 96-well plate to obtain at least two confirmed CRISPR edited parasite clones. To confirm the genotype of the edited parasites, parasite DNA was extracted from in vitro cultures using QIAamp DNA blood kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), per manufacturer""ôs instructions. Primers were ordered from Integrated DNA technologies (IDT, Newark, NJ) to amplify relevant candidate gene amplicons of 500""ì800bp lengths (S6 Table). Primers used for PCR are listed in S6 Table. For the verification of transfectants, primer combinations within and outside of the homology region were used to avoid amplifying the residual plasmid from transfection. PCR amplification was conducted using the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) following standard procedure. Amplicons were cleaned using ZymoKit DNA purification kit (Irvine, CA) per manufacturer""ôs instructions and sent for Sanger sequencing to Genewiz. Parasite growth assay Parasite growth assays were conducted over the course of five days. Synchronized rings were plated at 0.5% initial parasitemia and 2% HCT in 6-well plates. Parasitemia was monitored daily using MACSQuant Analyzer Flow Cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) through SYBR Green I staining (Lonza, Visp, Switzerland) for 30 minutes at 37¬∞C over the course of five days with two to three biological replicates per parasite line. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were first performed in groups of two using parametric unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch""ôs correction. If this resulted in a significantly different F test to compare variances for the pair, making the results of the Welch""ôs correction unreliable, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was conducted using GraphPad Prism version 6. PfCoronin homology modeling PfCoronin homology modeling was generated using SWISS-MODEL automated server [22] using Toxoplasma gondii Coronin crystal structure (4ozu.1) [24] (43.26% identity, 99% coverage, 0.77 GMQE, -2.49 QMEAN) was downloaded and visualized using Protean 3D software Version 12.0 (DNASTAR package, Madison, WI).

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was used globally as a first-line treatment for malaria after wide-spread resistance to chloroquine emerged and, although replaced by artemisinin combinations, is currently used as intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy and in young children as part of seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis in sub-Saharan Africa. The emergence of SP-resistant parasites has been predominantly driven by cumulative build-up of mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase (pfdhps) genes, but additional amplifications in the folate pathway rate-limiting pfgch1 gene and promoter, have recently been described. However, the genetic make-up and prevalence of those amplifications is not fully understood. We analyse the whole genome sequence data of 4,134 P. falciparum isolates across 29 malaria endemic countries, and reveal that the pfgch1 gene and promoter amplifications have at least ten different forms, occurring collectively in 23% and 34% in Southeast Asian and African isolates, respectively. Amplifications are more likely to be present in isolates with a greater accumulation of pfdhfr and pfdhps substitutions (median of 1 additional mutations; P<0.00001), and there was evidence that the frequency of pfgch1 variants may be increasing in some African populations, presumably under the pressure of SP for chemoprophylaxis and anti-folate containing antibiotics used for the treatment of bacterial infections. The selection of P. falciparum with pfgch1 amplifications may enhance the fitness of parasites with pfdhfr and pfdhps substitutions, potentially threatening the efficacy of this regimen for prevention of malaria in vulnerable groups. Our work describes new pfgch1 amplifications that can be used to inform the surveillance of SP drug resistance, its prophylactic use, and future experimental work to understand functional mechanisms.  Author summary Malaria causes approximately 435,000 deaths per year, concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and among children under the age of five years. Global efforts to control and eliminate malaria are hampered by the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites resistant to currently available antimalarial drugs. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was used globally as a first-line treatment for malaria and, although replaced by artemisinin combinations, is still used for the prevention of malarial disease in vulnerable groups (e.g. pregnant women). SP resistance is caused by mutations in the P. falciparum parasite genes pfdhfr and pfdhps, but recently novel structural variants in and around the pfgch1 gene have been described. By analysing genome sequence data of 4,134 P. falciparum across 29 malaria endemic countries, we establish there are at least ten different pfgch1 structural variants, existing in the presence of pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations, and occur increasingly and at high frequency in some Southeast Asian and African populations. These pfgch1 structural variants may enhance the survival of those parasites with pfdhfr and pfdhps substitutions, potentially threatening the efficacy of SP for prevention of malaria in vulnerable groups. Therefore it is important that they are monitored in molecular surveillance studies. Our work will assist epidemiological studies, laboratory and surveillance activities looking at the diversity and role of pfgch1 structural variants and their prevalence across malaria endemic regions, especially in countries using SP regimens.

Introduction The Plasmodium falciparum parasite inflicts high morbidity and mortality on human populations in malaria endemic regions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. To inform control measures, investigations of P. falciparum adaptation for host immune evasion, antimalarial drug resistance and other important biological mechanisms have focused on analyses of genome-wide polymorphisms [1, 2]. A number of studies have revealed SNPs and structural variants (e.g. duplications, amplifications or copy number variants) linked to antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and artemisinin [3]. SP is a combination drug which inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) enzymes in the folate pathway of the parasite, and is widely used as intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and in infants as part of seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis (SMC) in sub-Saharan Africa. SP became a first-line treatment for malaria after widespread resistance to chloroquine, but was replaced by artemisinin combination therapies for uncomplicated cases with the increasing prevalence of P. falciparum mutant alleles that confer the parasite resistance to pyrimethamine in pfdhfr (N51I, C59R, S108N, I164L) and to sulfadoxine in pfdhps (I431V, S436A/F, A437G, K540E/N, A581G, A613S/T) genes [4, 5]. Sequential accumulation of the several point mutations leads to increased levels of resistance by reducing binding affinity of the drug to the folate pathway enzymes dhps and dhfr [6]. Evidence across many countries has shown that longer term usage of SP leads to a greater risk of resistance haplotypes in pfdhps and pfdhfr genes [1]. The increased prevalence in parasites with resistant haplotypes is due to selection by drug pressure from the use of SP for IPTp and SMC as well as the use of anti-folate containing antibiotics. Fixation of some of the key SP-resistant mutations in the parasite population may occur, despite discontinuation of SP as the first-line treatment for more than a decade [7], and understanding these genetics dynamics is crucial for malarial disease control. Genomic analyses of the malaria parasites have revealed copy number variations of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene (pfgch1), which encodes the first and the rate-limiting enzyme in the folate biosynthesis pathway. Increased copy number of pfgch1 has been linked to SP resistance in Southeast Asia [8], with a direct association to pfdhfr and pfdhps alleles [9]. Similarly, a pfgch1 promoter copy number variation (amplification) in Malawian parasites with quintuple mutations (I51-R59-N108-G437-E540) has been identified, which differs from the whole gene amplification found in Southeast Asia [1, 10]. The multiple copies of pfgch1 are thought to compensate for the putatively fitness-reducing mutations in pfdhfr and pfdhps by providing higher concentrations of upstream substrates in the folate-biosynthetic pathway [10]. Here we investigate the genetic diversity in the pfgch1, pfdhfr and pfdhps genes across 4,134 P. falciparum isolates from 29 malaria endemic populations. Using both long and short sequence data, we reveal there are multiple forms of pfgch1 promoter and gene copy number variations, whose frequencies are heterogeneously distributed geographically, and linked to pfdhfr and pfdhps haplotypes. Worryingly, we reveal an overall trend towards an increased prevalence of the known pfdhfr and pfdhps resistant markers, which may be attributed to SP drug pressures, and that the presence of amplified pfgch1 is exacerbating the existing problem and may be assisting with maintaining these resistant parasites and the evolution of new mutants.  Materials and methods Short read sequencing data Publicly available raw sequence data were downloaded for P. falciparum field isolates (n = 6,236; 30 countries; from 2001 to 2015) from the European Nucleotide Archive (study accessions ERP000190 and ERP000199). These data include Illumina raw sequences from the MalariaGEN Community Project [11]. The data were aligned to the 3D7 strain reference genome (v3.1) using bwa-mem software (default parameters, except ‚Äìc 100 ‚ÄìT 50). Multiplicity of infection (MOI) was calculated using estMOI software [12] and the threshold was obtained based on previous work [13]. Samples with MOI >1 (estMOI > 30%) and overall genomic coverage <10-fold were removed from the dataset, leading to 5,280 isolates used for further analysis. SNPs and small indels were called using the samtools software suite, and those with a minor allele frequency >1% in drug resistance loci retained. The final dataset contained 4,134 samples (see pathogenseq.lshtm.ac.uk for a list of ENA accession numbers) without missing or mixed SNP genotype calls in pfdhfr, pfdhps and pfgch1. Large duplications were called by applying Delly software (v0.8.1) with default settings, and their breakpoints inferred using split-reads. All structural variants of low-quality (supporting paired-end calls < 3 or average mapping quality < 20) and >100kbp in length were removed, with 1,323 potential events located in the pfgch1 gene locus or its promoter region. All isolates with multiple calls in the region of interest were also removed and 1,273 remaining duplications were clustered (start and end breakpoints ¬± 50) to create 10 unique events. Coverage at a chromosome, regional and locus level was calculated from the alignment files for each isolate, and used to infer a pfgch1 gene and promoter copy number in those isolates with amplifications. The copy number estimation involved normalisation using a median coverage of isolates with no duplications. African samples were classified into geographical regions based on an established grouping [14]. Long read sequencing data Four laboratory parasite strains (K1 Thailand, D10 Papua New Guinea, NF54 Africa, T996 Thailand) were cultured under standard conditions [15] at the LSHTM and DNA was extracted using the Genomic-tip 100/G kit (QIAGEN) according to its protocol. The DNA was sequenced on the PacBio RSII long read technology. Chromosome-wide assemblies of PacBio sequence data were also available for a further five laboratory strains (7G8 Brazil, DD2 Indochina, GB4 Ghana, HB3 Honduras, IT Brazil) and nine field isolates (GN01 Guinea, SN01 Senegal, CD01 Congo, ML01 Mali, GA01 Gabon, KE01 Kenya, SD01 Sudan, and KH01 and KH02 Cambodia) (accession number ERP009847) [16]. Raw PacBio sequencing data were analysed in the SMRT Portal software using the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP3) pipeline, resulting in corrected long reads for each sample, and total genome sizes of 24Mbp. Corrected reads were aligned to the 3D7 reference genome (v3.1) using NGMLR (v0.2.7) software with default settings. Structural variants were identified using Sniffles (v1.0.11) software with default parameters. Manual verification was performed through alignment of candidate regions with the Mauve software [17]. All of the PacBio strains with reported structural variants in the pfgch1 locus or its promoter region were used to validate any possible putative duplications found in the Illumina short read analysis, estimate breakpoints, and distinguish different types of amplifications identified. Statistical analysis The calculation of the frequencies and visualisation of data were performed in R software using multiple packages (e.g. dplyr, tidyr, tibble, gggenes, rworldmap and tidyverse). Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the differences in mutation frequencies between structural variant and geographical groups. Genotypic resistance was established for chloroquine using pfcrt (C72S, M74I, N75D/E, K76T, A144F, L148I, I194T, A220S, Q271E, A326D/S, I356L/T and R371I) and pfmdr1 (N86Y) mutations [18‚Äì20], and for artemisinin using pfkelch13 mutations (F446I, Y493H, P574L, R539T, and C580Y) [21]. Pearson correlation coefficients and allelic associations (e.g. linkage disequilibrium r2) were calculated between SNPs and amplifications using the polycor and LDcorSV packages.  Discussion Monitoring of the polymorphisms in the P. falciparum genome associated with antimalarial drug resistance can be used to control and prevent malaria, support elimination strategies, and guide treatment choices. Surveillance is crucial for drugs like SP, which was replaced as a front-line treatment, and is now used prophylactically in pregnant women and children. Increasing numbers of pfdhfr and pfdhps resistance mutants due to selection by drug pressure have been observed, and increased copy number of pfgch1, which encodes the first and the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo folate biosynthesis, has been linked to SP resistance in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand [8]. Adaptations in pfgch1 gene are thought to compensate for the lower fitness in parasites with three or more mutations in pfdhfr or increase resistant in parasites with fewer polymorphisms [27]. The function of the promoter duplication remains unknown, however, it is plausible that it performs a similar role as the gene amplification. Moreover, multiple copies of pfgch1 have been shown to have a direct association with point mutations in pfdhfr (I164L) or pfdhps (K540E) in Southeast Asia [9], which is confirmed in our work. Similarly, in Malawi and other countries in Africa which have had prolonged SP use, a pfgch1 promoter duplication has been identified in parasites with pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations, distinct from the whole gene amplification found in Southeast Asia. Our analysis in 4,134 P. falciparum across 29 malaria endemic countries reveals a more fine-scaled picture of pfgch1 gene and promoter amplifications, reporting 12 different structural changes occurring in African or Asian populations. Using 18 strains with long read sequence data allowed us to robustly determine the breakpoints, including in regions of long mono-nucleotide (A or T) or AT/TA di-nucleotide repeats. The prevalence of amplifications was correlated with geography, with gene- and promoter-based types dominant in Southeast Asia and Africa, respectively. The divergence between continents and multiple types indicate an independent emergence of structural changes. Furthermore, the location of breakpoints in areas of mono- or di-nucleotide repeats, encourage even more distinctive variations due to an AT-rich genome of P. falciparum. Nonetheless, there were minor exceptions, including in Cameroon, DRC, Kenya and Ghana [10], where both promoter and gene amplifications were present. Further, the extent of amplification copy number appears to be linked to geography. For example, the Ghanaian (GB4) and Thailand (T996) strains had identical breakpoints, but the latter has one additional copy. Similarly, for the promoter amplification DupI, isolates from Southern and East African countries tended to have higher estimated copy number compared to the western and central regions of the continent. This regional difference is in part due to local evolution of strains exposed to SP (and other anti-folate drugs) over a longer period, resulting from differences in antimalarial drug implementation policy between countries. Higher numbers of pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations were correlated with the presence of pfgch1 amplifications in both Africa and Asia. Whilst, the relatively low numbers of pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations in Papua New Guinea and South America were accompanied by the absence of pfgch1 amplifications. The promoter amplification (DupI) and quintuple pfdhfr/pfdhps genotype (IRNIS-ISGEAA) were linked in African populations, whilst the septuple (IRNLS-ISGEGA) mutant was linked with gene amplifications (DupE and DupF) in Asia. The prevalence of pfgch1 gene and promoter amplifications and occurrence of pfdhfr/pfdhps mutants in Africa broadly overlaps with the duration and degree of SP usage as a first-line treatment. Malawi abandoned chloroquine early and has had the longest SP exposure with >10 years as a first-line treatment, and almost all isolates contained pfgch1 promoter amplifications, pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple mutants and pfcrt wild-type alleles. Whereas, Kenya and Tanzania introduced SP five or more years after Malawi, and ‚àº65% isolates had promoter amplifications and a low prevalence of pfcrt resistance alleles (<40%). Further, across the seven years of data from Kenya, there was an increase in both the prevalence of pfgch1 promoter amplifications and pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple mutants. In Southeast Asia the near fixation of chloroquine resistance alleles and higher levels of SP related pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations, were in tandem with 20% pfgch1 amplification frequency, particularly in Thailand and Myanmar. Interestingly, in Southeast Asia there was an allelic association between pfcrt I356T and pfdhfr I164L, most probably due to the high historical usage of both antimalarial drugs. Overall, whilst there may be some limitations with the convenience nature of the P. falciparum sampling, the trend towards longer SP exposure and an increase in drug resistance polymorphisms makes it essential to monitor structural changes in the pfgch1 locus and the number of pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations as well as correlations between them. Pfgch1 gene expression may modify SP sensitivity [30], and further analysis studying the expression of different pfgch1 amplifications with relation to pfdhfr/pfdhps could provide additional insights into SP resistance. In lieu of further whole genome sequencing, drug resistance assays, and allelic manipulation of P. falciparum to understand functional mechanisms, our work has characterised new forms of pfgch1 amplification, which can be used as the basis of enhanced surveillance for SP efficacy.  Conclusion The SP combination is still the only antimalarial drug treatment recommended by WHO for intermittent preventive treatment in vulnerable populations, because of its safety in pregnant women and infants and its long action. The selection of P. falciparum with pfgch1 amplifications may enhance the fitness of parasites with pfdhfr and pfdhps substitutions, intensifying the persistence of SP resistance, and potentially threatening the efficacy of this regimen for prevention of malaria in vulnerable groups. Our work has revealed new forms of pfgch1 amplification, which can be used for surveillance activities.

Photo by VnExpress/An Phu.  A man from Vinh Long Province, who illegally entered Vietnam and was diagnosed with Covid-19, reportedly paid VND50 million ($2,155) to a people smuggling gang to return home.  The 32-year-old, one of six people who illegally entered from Cambodia through An Giang Province on December 24, tested positive for the coronavirus two days later, but had been ""anxious and worried the gang would hurt his family if he revealed its operations to local authorities,"" his mother Tran Thi Hang said via phone from a quarantine facility in Mang Thit District.  Ignoring all fears, Hang advised her son to clearly declare his travel history to local authorities so that they prevent risk of further Covid-19 outbreak of community transmission; otherwise everything would be very dangerous.  The man had gone to Myanmar illegally to work, but the pandemic caused his company to suspend operations, and he did not have a job.  To return home, he contacted the people smuggling gang via social media and was asked for VND50 million, to be paid online.  Hang said he called home and asked his family to transfer VND37 million to the gang's account.  On December 22 Hang went to HCMC but only transferred VND25 million into an unidentified woman's account.  The next day her son called and said he had been abandoned at the edge of a forest on the Thai border since the full amount was not sent.  Her daughter immediately transferred the remaining VND12 million owed to the gang.  He and five others, all Vietnamese nationals, had traveled from Myanmar to Thailand by truck on December 15 and stayed there until December 22 before leaving for Cambodia on December 23.  On December 24 they crossed into Vietnam by boat across Binh Di River and were picked up in a car. He returned home in Vinh Long Province while the other 32-year-old woman moved to Dong Thap Province and the remaining to HCMC. Four of six have been confirmed infected with the novel coronavirus.  ""He was in close contact with me for 30 minutes upon returning home. I found him showing abnormal signs and he looked pale, scared and worried,"" Hang recalled.  Fearing that her son contracted the virus when traveling illegally through many countries, she immediately reported to local authorities.  He was then sent to a quarantine facility at Mang Thit District's medical center and had his samples taken for Covid-19 test. On December 26, his test result showed he was positive for the virus and he was transferred to Vinh Long Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases Hospital for treatment.  Doctor Van Cong Minh, director of Vinh Long's Department of Health, said ""patient 1440"" is now in stable condition and he didn't show signs of cough and fever. His psychology was also better and he was no longer panic and anxious as before.  Hang and 14 others in close contact with the man are being quarantined and have not yet showed signs of contracting the virus.  Colonel Huynh Thanh Mong, deputy director of Vinh Long Provincial Police, said that police are working to clarify the illegal crossing ring as the case involves many localities. Authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the case.  So far this year, over 14,000 people have illegally entered the country, the Ministry of Public Security said, adding that the rising number of illegal entrants is posing a major threat to the country's anti-Covid-19 fight.  Vietnam has a land border of more than 5,000 km, 117 land border gates and 88 border crossings that border China, Laos and Cambodia.  Vietnam's current Covid-19 tally stands at 1,456 and 35 deaths.  It has gone 28 days without community transmissions. Authorities have taken drastic measures to trace all those who've come into close contact with the illegal entrants who've made up the latest Covid-19 cases.","fever, cough",Where did the patient go for COVID-19 testing?,quarantine facility at Mang Thit District's medical center ,Where did the patient go for treatment?,Vinh Long Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases Hospital ,Which palces had the patiet traveled?,"Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand",,

(2020) An investig-ation into the epidemiology of chikungunya virus across neglected regions of Indonesia. PLoS Ne","Chikungunya virus strains from recent outbreaks across Indonesia all belong to a single clade. However, low-level seroprevalence and molecular detection of CHIKV across the three study sites appears to contrast with the generally high seroprevalences that have been reported for non-outbreak settings in Java and Bali, and may account for the relative lack of CHIKV epidemiological data from other regions of Indonesia.  Four hundred and seventy nine acutely febrile patients presenting between September 2017""ì2019 were recruited from three city hospitals situated in Ambon, Maluku; Banjarmasin, Kalimantan; and Batam, Batam Island as part of a multi-site observational study. CHIKV RNA was detected in a single serum sample while a separate sample was IgM positive. IgG seroprevalence was also low across all three sites, ranging from 1.4""ì3.2%. The single RT-PCR positive sample from this study and 24 archived samples collected during other recent outbreaks throughout Indonesia were subjected to complete coding region sequencing to assess the genetic diversity of Indonesian strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed all to be of a single clade, which was distinct from CHIKV strains recently reported from neighbouring regions including the Philippines and the Pacific Islands.  Additional analysis of 25 recent Indonesian CHIKV genome sequences revealed that a new lineage of CHIKV has recently emerged in Indonesia. Several reports have highlighted Indonesia as a major source of imported CHIKV cases, suggesting that this new lineage has the potential to be introduced into neighbouring countries in the near future, with unknown consequences. Overall, our results indicate that additional CHIKV surveillance studies in Indonesia and Southeast Asia are needed in order to gain a clearer understanding of transmission routes and hot spots throughout the region.  Outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are a common occurrence in Indonesia. However, limited data is available on CHIKV from regions outside of the main, central islands of Java and Bali. We recruited hospital patients from three cities located in the east (Ambon), west (Batam) and north (Banjarmasin) of the country, and screened their blood for evidence of CHIKV infection. Our results showed that CHIKV infections were relatively uncommon across patients from all three sites, suggesting that CHIKV transmission is currently relatively rare in these regions.

In this study, we aimed to characterise the contribution of CHIKV to febrile illness across three major regional cities in the east (Batam, Riau Islands), north (Banjamarsin, South Kalimantan) and west (Ambon, Maluku) of the country. Serum samples from febrile patients that had tested negative for dengue virus were tested for evidence of CHIKV infection by serology and RT-PCR. RT-PCR positive samples, including an additional set of archived samples, were subjected to genomic sequencing, and the resulting sequences were used to examine CHIKV evolutionary dynamics both within the country and in relation to the other countries of Southeast Asia.  Despite suffering decades of outbreaks, official data on CHIKV incidence in Indonesia appears to be neglected, as CHIKV was not included in either of the 2018 or 2019 Ministry of Health annual reports ( S1 Fig ). Additionally, the vast majority of CHIKV epidemiology studies that have taken place in Indonesia have been largely restricted to the major, central islands of Java and Bali. This focus has made it difficult to ascertain whether CHIKV epidemiology in these densely populated regions is comparable to other parts of the country.  In Indonesia, outbreaks of CHIKV have been regularly recorded for almost half a century. The first officially recognized outbreak in the country occurred in Samarinda, East Kalimantan in 1973 [ 12 ]. Since this time, reports of isolated CHIKV outbreaks in Indonesia have become more frequent. These reports reached a peak during a nationwide epidemic, which occurred between 2009""ì2010, resulting in 137,655 cases and dwarfing past case counts, which had never previously exceeded 10,000 a year [ 12 ]. Since 2011, official CHIKV case rates in Indonesia have returned to levels similar to those reported prior to the epidemic ( S1 Fig ). However, sporadic outbreaks have continued to occur across the archipelago [ 13 ""ì 15 ]. Notably, two studies screening symptomatic travellers returning to Taiwan (2006""ì2009) and Japan (2006""ì2016) [ 16 , 17 ], found individuals returning from Indonesia were the most common source of imported cases of CHIKV. This highlights Indonesia's potential as a source of CHIKV transmission for the region; as the presence of competent vector species in Taiwan and Japan means that there is potential for an imported case of CHIKV to lead to local transmission, such as that documented in Italy in 2007 [ 18 ].  Sporadic outbreaks of Asian genotype CHIKV have been reported in South and Southeast Asian countries including Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines since the 1950s [ 4 ]. Following the widespread introduction of ECSA strains into Asia, outbreaks of both genotypes have been reported throughout the region, including co-circulation of the two in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia. In Southeast Asia, CHIKV is primarily transmitted by the urban mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which maintains the virus in a mosquito-human-mosquito cycle [ 5 ]. CHIKV is endemic to many countries in this region, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, where it is continuously maintained through persistent low-level transmission in the local population [ 4 ]. This is punctuated by larger, epidemic outbreaks, which occur at irregular intervals of between 2""ì20 years [ 6 ]. It is also postulated that CHIKV may be maintained in the mosquito population by vertical and horizontal transmission, both processes that have been demonstrated experimentally [ 7 , 8 ] but not confirmed in the field. The existence of a mammalian reservoir host has also been suggested, and antibodies against the virus have been detected in macaque populations in both the Philippines [ 9 ] and Malaysia [ 10 ], suggesting wildlife may be involved in maintaining the virus between epidemics. However, their role in maintenance of the virus is as yet unproven as an earlier survey of macaques in Sri Lanka revealed all to be serologically negative [ 11 ].  Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a zoonotic pathogen belonging to the Alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. The virus is arthropod-borne, transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes species mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that CHIKV can be divided into three genotypes historically defined by their distinct geographical regions: the West African genotype, the Asian genotype, and the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotype [ 1 ]. In recent years, 2 of these genotypes have spread into new areas. The ECSA genotype has given rise to the Indian Ocean lineage (IOL), which emerged in 2004 and rapidly spread across the islands of the Indian Ocean, India and South-East Asia [ 2 ]. In 2013, the Asian genotype, endemic to many countries in Southeast Asia, was introduced to the Americas, giving rise to major epidemics throughout the continent [ 3 ] and has since become established in the region.  A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was constructed from an alignment of all full-length CHIKV sequences available from GenBank as of 9 th January 2020, using IQTree v1.6.11, implementing modelfinder and 1000 repetitions of the ultrafast bootstrap approximation method [ 30 ""ì 32 ]. A time measured, maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny was also inferred from an alignment of 135 complete and partial (> 1000 nt) coding sequences belonging to the Asian genotype using BEAST v1.10.4 [ 33 ]. To construct the phylogeny, CHIKV genomic nucleotide sequences of appropriate length were retrieved from GenBank using the search term: ""Chikungunya virus""[porgn] AND (biomol_genomic[PROP] AND (""1000""[SLEN]: ""13000""[SLEN]), aligned using MAFFT and a draft ML phylogeny was constructed using IQTree as described above. Sequences clustered within the Asian genotype clade were extracted (n = 357) and the associated metadata was parsed from GenBank files using gbmunge ( https://github.com/sdwfrost/gbmunge ). For sequences with missing metadata, a manual search of the literature was performed to identify the year of collection and country of origin. Sequences were excluded if this information was not readily available. Identical sequences were removed from the dataset using CD-hit-est, by clustering those with 100% identity [ 34 ] and the Americas lineage clade was reduced to 5 representative sequences to allow a clearer visualisation of the overall phylogeny. Finally, the temporal signal of the dataset was assessed by plotting the tip-to-root distance against time of sampling in R v.3.6.3, in the manner employed by TempEst [ 35 ], followed by removal of any outliers. BEAST analysis was implemented with a general time reversible (GTR) model using a discretized gamma distribution with four categories (G4) plus invariant sites, a relaxed lognormal molecular clock, and a GMRF Bayesian skyride prior for effective population size. The resulting ML and MCC phylogenies were visualized using the ggplot2, ggtree, ape, colorspace and treeio packages in R v3.6.3 [ 36 ""ì 38 ]. Multiple sequence alignment files, BEAST XML, log and tree files are available at: 10.5281/zenodo.3891450. Raw sequence data have been deposited in ENA under study PRJEB39967. Newly generated consensus sequences have been deposited in GenBank and their accession numbers are presented in Table 1 .  Raw FAST5 output files were base-called using the default settings of Guppy v3.1.5 (ONT), discarding reads with a q-score below 7. De-multiplexing was performed using Qcat v1.0.7 (ONT) with default settings and the de-multiplexed FASTQ sequences were aligned to the CHIKV RefSeq sequence (NC_004162.2) using BWA mem v0.7.17 (option -x ont2d) [ 26 ]. Consensus genome sequences were generated from alignment files using samtools as previously described [ 27 ]. Finally, the consensus genomes were aligned using MAFFT v7.427 [ 28 ] and any major discrepancies such as indels or multiple consecutive SNPs were manually verified or corrected by referring back to the BAM read alignment file, viewed using Tablet v1.19.09.03 [ 29 ]. All consensus sequences were uploaded to Genbank under accession numbers MT591083""îMT591107 ( Table 1 ).  A single RT-PCR positive sample from this study and 24 archived samples collected during other recent Indonesian outbreaks were subjected to complete coding region sequencing ( Table 1 ). Viral RNA was reverse transcribed, amplified using a multiplex PCR tiling method, and sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION platform as previously described [ 25 ]. Multiplex sequencing libraries were prepared using the ONT Native Barcoding kit (EXP-NBD103) and the ONT 1D Ligation Sequencing kit (SQK-LSK108) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting libraries were purified, loaded onto FLO-MIN106 flow-cells and sequenced using MinKNOW software v1.13.1.  Statistical comparisons of age and sex ratios between sites were performed in R v3.6.3 [ 22 ] using the Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test and Pearson's Chi-squared test respectively. Binomial confidence intervals for the observed IgG seropositivity rates were calculated using the Hmisc package in R [ 23 ]. A binomial regression using a complementary log-log link was fitted to the data and associations between IgG status and patient age, gender and location were tested by ANOVA using likelihood ratios, with the ""òcar' package in R [ 24 ].  Viral RNA was extracted from 200 ŒºL sera using the MagNA Pure LC Total NA extraction kit (Roche, Switzerland) before being subjected to an alphavirus-specific RT-PCR as previously described [ 19 ]. Negative and positive controls for PCR were included in each batch and an RNA internal control from the Simplexa Dengue assay (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA) was used to monitor the RNA extraction process and to detect RT-PCR inhibition as part of a separate assay for dengue virus testing. Single RT-PCR replicates were run due to limitations in resources. Serum specimens with adequate volume remaining following RT-PCR were tested in duplicate for CHIKV IgM and IgG by in-house ELISA using acetone-extracted CHIKV antigen (strain Ross) as previously described [ 20 , 21 ]. ELISA units were calculated using the formula:  Individuals between the age of 6 months and 75 years, presenting with fever greater than 38¬∞C for less than 5 days were recruited for this observational study from three city hospitals (S1 STROBE checklist): RS Santa Elisabeth situated in the west of Indonesia (Batam, Riau Islands), RS Ansari Saleh in central Indonesia (Banjamarsin, South Kalimantan) and RS Haulussy in east Indonesia (Ambon, Maluku) between September 2017 and September 2019. Sites were selected for their similar population size and healthcare infrastructure capacity. The sites are the capitals and largest cities (> 500,000 inhabitants) in their respective regions: Batam in Riau province, Ambon in Maluku province, and Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan province and represent three distinct regions of Indonesia, as reflected in their time zones (Western Indonesia Time, Central Indonesia Time, and Eastern Indonesia Time). Upon hospital admission, single 3 to 5 ml blood samples were taken during the acute phase. Sera were separated by centrifugation and kept frozen at -20¬∞ C until further processing. Patient sera were tested for dengue virus (DENV) by RT-qPCR and those testing negative were tested for evidence of CHIKV infection by serology and RT-PCR.  The 7 amino acid deletion (nsP3 376-382 ) observed in every strain of the current Indonesian clade was confirmed in several isolates by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Conversely, every strain from the non-Indonesian clade was found to possess a deletion of 4 amino acids at the same site (nsP3 379-382 ). This smaller deletion was also observed in several older Indonesian strains isolated between 2009""ì2013 but not in ancestral Asian genotype strains, which were isolated from Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in the 1970's and 1980's. The deletion in nsP3 was also absent from two of the three Malaysian strains isolated in 2006 and 2007. However, the presence of nsP3 376-382 in one of the Malaysian isolates suggests that the deletion occurred either prior to, or during, the Malaysian outbreak in 2006, in a strain that later gave rise to the new Indonesian lineage.  Predicted translational differences between Asian genotype clades were observed in 6 of the 9 CHIKV genes ( Table 3 ). Three of these predicted differences were identified as specific to the current Indonesian clade: a 7 amino acid deletion in the nsP3 gene (nsP3 376-382 ), a glutamine to arginine substitution at position 307 of the E2 gene (E2-Q307A), and an alanine to threonine substitution at position 321 of the E1 gene (E1-A321T). These differences were present in all strains of the current Indonesian clade except for the strains isolated in Tomohon. The Tomohon strains shared the 7 amino acid deletion nsP3 376-382 but retained an alanine at position 321 of the E1 gene, and displayed a unique E2-Q307H substitution in the E2 gene. The E1-321A residue observed in the predicted sequence of the Tomohon strains was also present in Asian genotype strains clustered outside of the current Indonesian clade, including sequences ancestral to both clades. This is consistent with the results of the phylogenetic analysis, which placed the Tomohon strains at the base of the Indonesian clade ( Fig 2 ).  In order to compare predicted amino acid differences between Asian genotype clades, 24 strains were selected to represent five distinct phylogenetic groups, which are highlighted by boxes in Fig 2 . These groups corresponded to: 1) strains from the clade currently circulating in Indonesia; 2) Malaysian strains ancestrally related to the current Indonesian clade; 3) strains at the ancestral root of the entire Asian genotype clade; 4) older Indonesian strains closely related to strains currently circulating outside of Indonesia and; 5) strains from the Asian genotype clade in circulation outside of Indonesia, including strains from The Philippines, Korea, the Pacific Islands and the Americas.  The single isolate from Ambon on Maluku Island, also clustered separately from most other samples sequenced in this study. The closest relatives to the Ambon strain were several strains detected in Taiwanese tourists returning from unspecified locations in Indonesia in 2014 and 2015, as well as two isolates sampled during the Jambi 2015 outbreak, one of which was sequenced as part of the current study (JMB-172). These two isolates from Jambi clustered separately from the vast majority of Jambi isolates, suggesting they were not the primary strain responsible for the 2015 outbreak in the city.  The three isolates collected from the remote site of Tomohon, North Sulawesi, in 2014""ì15, grouped together to form part of a small sub-cluster at the base of the main Indonesian clade. This sub-cluster, which also contained a strain isolated from Malaysia in 2009, was estimated to have diverged from the wider Indonesian lineage in 2006 (95% HPD: 2005""ì2007).  The samples sequenced in this study displayed a strong degree of similarity by region. Isolates from the 2015 outbreak in Jambi, Sumatra, were found to be closely related to each other, as well as to previously sequenced isolates from the same outbreak (KX097988, KX097981, KX097982). Similarly, isolates from the 2016 outbreak in Buleleng, Northern Bali, were also closely related to each other. The Buleleng outbreak strains appear to form part of an Indonesian lineage that has been repeatedly isolated between 2012""ì2014. These isolates include several cases from Bali in 2013 and 2014 (e.g. KM673291 and KY649630), and several strains isolated from Taiwanese travellers returning from undefined regions of Indonesia in the same years (e.g. KU561450 and KU561455). A single sequence deposited by researchers in Singapore was also present in this cluster, however the origin of this isolate is unclear. Two of the 2017 isolates from Tabanan in Southern Bali were also closely related to the Buleleng 2016 outbreak strain. However, a further three isolates sampled from Tabanan in 2017 and 2018 appeared to be more closely related to the Jambi 2015 outbreak strain, suggesting co-circulation of the two strains in Tabanan.  More recent Indonesian strains all clustered within a second major clade (boxes 1 and 2), which predominantly contained isolates from Indonesia sampled in 2010 or later. Exceptions to this were a Malaysian isolate from 2009, a New Caledonian isolate from 2011, a Chinese isolate from 2012, and a Singaporean isolate from 2013. At the base of the clade, a cluster of Malaysian isolates formed a small, closely related group, estimated to have last shared a common ancestor with the Indonesian strains in 2002 (95% HPD: 2000""ì2003). These Malaysian isolates were sampled during a nationwide outbreak in 2006, including one isolated from a macaque in 2007.  The first of these clades (boxes 4 and 5) contained the majority of Asian genotype strains that have been recently isolated outside of Indonesia from countries including Singapore between 2013""ì2016, the Philippines between 2012""ì2016, Korea in 2014, and the Pacific Islands between 2014""ì2016. A number of strains from Indonesia were also present in this clade, all of which were isolated between 2007""ì2014. The majority of these Indonesian isolates clustered into a distinct, but closely related group at the base of the clade. No strains belonging to this Indonesian group have been isolated since 2014.  The phylogeny was generated using all available Asian genotype strains, including a combination of full-length coding sequences and E1/E2 sequences (>1000 bp). Strains sequenced as part of this study are labelled in red. Colored tips denote the region of origin for each isolate. Major nodes of interest are labelled with their mean height and 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals and posterior support values. The sub-clades, whose predicted amino acid sequences are compared in Table 3 , are highlighted by dashed boxes and numbered accordingly. The Americas lineage included in box 5 was pruned to better visualise the overall phylogeny.  Sera with sufficient volume remaining (n = 460) were tested for the presence of anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies by ELISA: 69 from Ambon (median age = 10 y.o.; inter-quartile range (IQR) = 5""ì23; male to female ratio (M:F) = 1.56), 207 from Banjarmasin (median age = 16 y.o.; IQR = 10""ì24 y.o.; M:F = 1.11) and 184 from Batam (median age = 13 y.o.; IQR = 4""ì26; M:F = 1.19). No statistically significant differences in age (p > 0.05) or gender ratio (p > 0.05) were observed between sites. In total, IgG antibodies were detected in sera from 11/460 patients, giving an overall prevalence of 2.4% (95% C.I. = 1.3""ì4.2%) ( Table 2 ). IgG seroprevalence ranged from 1.4% in Banjarmasin (95% C.I. = 0.5""ì4.2%) to 3.3% in Batam (95% C.I. = 1.5""ì7.0%). Overall IgG seroprevalence increased with age, with the exception of patients older than 50 years old (0/22). However, no statistically significant association was observed between IgG status and age, gender or site (all p > 0.05). Considering individual sites; in Banjarmasin, all IgG positive sera (n = 3) were obtained from patients aged 26 or over, whereas in Batam, all IgG positive sera (n = 6) were obtained from patients younger than 30 years old. However, neither trend was statistically significant (p > 0.05).  A total of 479 sera were tested for the presence of CHIKV RNA by RT-PCR and anti-CHIKV IgM by ELISA: 80 from Ambon, 208 from Banjarmasin and 191 from Batam ( S1 Table ). RT-PCR revealed the presence of alphavirus RNA in the serum of a 3-year-old, female patient from Ambon (AMB-041). Subsequent Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of CHIKV. IgM antibodies were detected in a single patient from Banjarmasin, a 38-year-old male. The same patient's serum was also positive for anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies.  Discussion  Molecular and serological testing of 479 febrile patients revealed that just 0.5% of cases (95% C.I. = 0.0""ì2.7%) across the three study sites were associated with CHIKV infection (RNA or IgM positive). In comparison, similar studies of febrile patients in a non-outbreak setting have reported CHIKV infection rates of 0.6% in Cambodia [39], 1.1% in Thailand [40] and 7.5% in the Philippines [41]. Within Indonesia, a prospective study, conducted at a single site in Bandung, central Java, between 2000""ì2004 and 2006""ì2008 reported CHIKV infections in 7.1% of febrile patients outside of any outbreak [42], while another recent multi-site study conducted in Java and Bali between 2013""ì16 reported a prevalence of 3.7% in febrile, dengue-negative patients [43] suggesting that, at present, CHIKV transmission is more common in these areas.  Overall, our study found that 2.4% (95% CI: 1.3""ì4.2%) of febrile patients across the three sites had previously been exposed to CHIKV. This is also relatively low in comparison to the results of a recent study of febrile patients in central Indonesia, which reported IgG seroprevalence rates ranging from 25.2""ì45.9% across 7 cities in Java, Bali and South Sulawesi [43]. High rates have also previously been reported for febrile patients from other countries in Asia, including the Philippines (57.5%), Vietnam (50.0%) and Sri Lanka (38.0%) [44]. However, a cross-sectional study of healthy adults (18""ì75 y.o.) in Singapore reported a similar rate to that observed here (2.2%), despite the country having experienced a CHIKV outbreak the previous year [45].  A recent meta-analysis of Indonesian studies reported an average IgG seropositivity rate of 14.1% (0.0% - 43.9%) for febrile patients in non-outbreak settings [12]. The majority of these studies were undertaken in Java and Bali. However, three reports from the sites of this study were included: in Ambon, a 1971 study described a similar IgG seroprevalence of 3.1% in febrile patients using a plaque-reduction neutralization test [46], while a study conducted the following year using a hemagglutination inhibition assay reported a seroprevalence of 11.5% [47]. A strong age-specific effect was observed in the second study; IgG seroprevalence increased from 2.7% in patients younger than 30, to 41.2% in those older than 30. Such a strong effect was not detected here, however a comparable seroprevalence of 1.7% was observed in patients younger than 30. It is possible that the overall difference in seroprevalence is due to no major CHIKV outbreaks having occurred in the region in the past 50 years. Indeed, patients involved in the 1972 study (0""ì9 y.o.), who now fall into the eldest two age groups in the present study (45""ì50+ y.o.), revealed no IgG positive cases in either instance. The same study also reported an IgG seroprevalence of 21.8% in febrile patients in Balikpapan, a city situated 500 km to the northeast of Banjarmasin. Seroprevalence was high across all age groups at this site, including 36% of individuals between 0""ì9 y.o. and was significantly higher than other sites included in the study. Such an observation could possibly be explained by an outbreak of CHIKV having recently occurred in the region. In the present study, all 3 IgG positive cases in Banjarmasin were detected in adults (26""ì41 y.o). However, none were old enough to have participated in the previous study (>46 y.o.). Only 16 patients fell into this age range, indicating that additional sampling may be required for a more robust assessment of seroprevalence in older age groups.  The low seroprevalence observed in Ambon, Batam and Banjarmasin compared to cities in central Indonesia [43] may be due to an absence of recent outbreaks in the study regions. A similar regional difference has been reported from other Southeast Asian countries where the virus is endemic, including Thailand, where IgG seroprevalance was observed to be significantly lower in participants younger than 30 y.o. in the centre of the country (5.0%) compared to the south (15.6%), which had experienced two outbreaks in the past 20 years [48]. Study settings may also affect the reported prevalence, as a cross-sectional study of healthy adults (>35 y.o.) throughout Malaysia described a significant in difference in IgG seroprevalence between urban (7.1%) and rural (10.36%) dwelling participants [49].  Phylogenetic analysis of 25 newly generated sequences has demonstrated that the Asian genotype of CHIKV remains the dominant clade in Indonesia, despite a brief incursion by the ECSA genotype between 2008""ì2011. Further analysis of the Asian genotype clade revealed that the lineage currently circulating in Indonesia is genetically distinct from Filipino strains, as well as from those circulating in Indonesia prior to 2014. Strains from the current Indonesian lineage appear to have emerged in Indonesia between 2010""ì2013 and have been almost exclusively isolated from Indonesia and Malaysia, suggesting that the lineage is endemic to these two neighbouring countries. Unfortunately, no Asian genotype CHIKV sequences have been reported from Malaysia since 2009, and so it is not possible to ascertain whether strains from this lineage have remained in circulation there as they have in Indonesia.  An examination of the predicted amino acid sequences revealed several non-synonymous differences between the two main Southeast Asian clades of CHIKV. Specifically, a 7 amino acid deletion in the nsP3 gene, and E2-Q307R and E1-A321T residues in the structural genes defined the Indonesian clade. While the 7 amino acid deletion was present in all Indonesian isolates examined, the substitutions in the E1 and E2 genes were absent in a single strain isolated from Tomohon in 2015. Many of the predicted amino acid differences found in the Indonesian clade isolates were also observed in the closely related Malaysian strains from 2006""ì2007. These strains were isolated from both humans and macaques, and slight amino acid differences between isolates from these two hosts have been previously described [50]. All of the Indonesian strains sequenced as part of this study displayed the amino acid residues associated with a human host, namely: an arginine residue at position 221 of the nsP1 gene and the 7 amino acid deletion in the nsP3 gene.  It is unclear what effect, if any, the predicted differences in the nsP3, E1 and E2 genes might have on the virus. The 7 amino acid deletion of nsP3 was located in the C-terminal hyper-variable domain (HVD), which frequently contains significant deletions that appear to have no effect on the virus. However, this domain is involved in a high number of within-cell, host-protein interactions, which has led to suggestions that it may be involved in adaptation of the virus to new hosts [51]. Given the absence of the deletion in otherwise similar macaque isolates in Malaysia, one could speculate that it may be the result of zoonotic emergence from macaques into humans. The relevance of two further predicted differences, E1-T321A and E2-Q307R, in the envelope sequences of all strains within the current Indonesian clade, except a single strain from Tomohon has not been studied. However the E1 and E2 genes code for the two major surface glycoproteins of CHIKV, and are closely associated with transmissibility of the virus [52].  The Indonesian strains sequenced as part of this study largely clustered according to their region of origin. However, multiple strains were found to be in co-circulation in both Jambi in 2015, and Tabanan in 2017. There was also evidence of transmission occurring between geographically distinct regions: a close relative of one of the strains circulating in Jambi, Sumatra, in 2015 was later detected in Tabanan, Bali in 2017, while a distinct Jambi strain was related to the strain isolated from Ambon several years later. This finding possibly highlights Jambi as an important source of CHIKV transmission to other parts of Indonesia. However, this interpretation should be treated with caution, as, without knowing patient travel history, we cannot be certain as to whether infections were acquired locally or elsewhere.  Unsurprisingly, outbreak strains such as those in Jambi were highly inter-related, likely due to the rapid transmission that occurs during local epidemics. However, it is interesting to note that close relatives of the strain responsible for the 2016 outbreak in Buleleng, Bali, had been reported from the island 2 years earlier. Close relatives of the same strain were also detected in Tabanan, southern Bali in 2017. This finding suggests that additional, non-virological factors played a role in the Buleleng outbreak. Indeed, an entomological survey in Buleleng following the outbreak reported a high percentage of houses contained mosquito egg-laying sites (55%) [15]","chikungunya, dengue",What diseases are featured in this article?,"chikungunya, dengue",Where has there been a recent chikungunya outbreak?,Indonesia,Where are the hospitals mentioned in this study located?,"Ambon, Maluku; Banjarmasin, Kalimantan; and Batam, Batam Island ",,

Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters  By Kelly ServickJan. 12, 2021 , 5:20 PM Influenza f","COVID-19 measures also suppress flu-for now  Influenza forecasters are a cautious bunch. Flu cases can spike in late winter after months of low infection rates, making experts reluctant to predict a mild season too soon. But many are ready to declare that COVID-19 control measures have dramatically tamped down the flu and other respiratory viruses that would normally be ripping through the Northern Hemisphere.  The World Health Organization (WHO), based on global surveillance data collected through late last month, says flu activity in the Northern Hemisphere is at ""interseasonal levels,""ù meaning it's as low as in an ordinary summer. In the United States, the percentage of outpatient visits for influenzalike illness is at 1.6%, well below the 2.6% baseline used to define a seasonal epidemic. U.S. clinical labs have collected 925 positive samples since the end of September 2020, versus 63,975 at this point in the 2019""ì20 flu season.  ""I'd be very surprised if we have a typical flu season now,""ù says John McCauley, a virologist who directs the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute in London. ""To see nothing so far, it's difficult to see how it's going to come up in large numbers in January.""ù  For now, that's a relief. Fearing a flu surge on top of the pandemic, many European countries ramped up fall immunization campaigns, says Cornelia Adlhoch, an epidemiologist at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported record flu vaccine distribution; surveys showed adult vaccination climbed from 42% in 2019 to 53% in 2020.  ""But I don't think it's the vaccine""ù that accounts for the mercifully light flu season, McCauley says. Instead, he and others point to COVID-19 measures such as mask wearing, social distancing, and travel restrictions. As in the Southern Hemisphere early last year, efforts that failed to fully control SARS-CoV-2 have brought less infectious seasonal viruses to heel-including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes serious illness in infants and the elderly.  For virologist Trevor Bedford of the University of Washington, Seattle, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the unusual flu season means a challenge. His team analyzes flu virus genomes collected by WHO's surveillance network to identify emerging strains, which the next year's flu vaccine will have to protect against. ""Generally, we have thousands of viruses to look at, and it's still challenging,""ù he says. This season, just 127 sequences were collected between 1 September 2020 and 1 January 2021, versus 12,218 in that period the year before.  Flu away The number of influenza-positive samples reported by U.S. clinical laboratories remains low in 2020""ì21 compared with past years, even though labs are testing tens of thousands of samples per week. Positive samples 5000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 2020""ì21 2019""ì20 2018""ì19 2017""ì18 2016""ì17 2015""ì16 0 November December January February March April May  Many are a genetic variant of a flu virus that recently emerged in Cambodia, Bangladesh, and India and has caused a small seasonal outbreak, Bedford says. ""That's the strain I suspect would be the one we'd pick [as a component of] the vaccine if we had to pick it today.""ù WHO will convene a group in February to decide on the composition of the next vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere.  Natural immunity to flu might suffer from this anomalous season. Fewer infections one season can lead to a larger susceptible population and a bigger outbreak the next. ""We saw cases go down, and as disease modelers, we knew ""¶ there might be a bit of a twist,""ù says Rachel Baker, an epidemiologist at Princeton University. In a November 2020 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Baker and colleagues simulated future flu and RSV outbreaks in more than 300 U.S. counties and Mexican states assuming a 20% reduction in transmission of those viruses this year. For some locations, their model predicted outbreaks in the winter of 2021""ì22 that were double the size of typical years'.  More susceptibility could also lead to outbreaks outside peak virus season, Baker says. She suspects that's happening in Australia: After unusually low rates of RSV in the Southern Hemisphere's winter, the country began to lift lockdowns. Some Australian states documented a spike in October 2020, as summer approached, and continue to report above-average levels.  Flu outbreaks are less predictable, however, and might not rebound in the same way, Baker says; in her team's model, suppressing flu transmission one season didn't consistently boost incidence in the next. And if worries about a spike next year inspire more flu shots, ""a larger outbreak might be thwarted,""ù she says.  Bedford says a less welcome development might also mitigate a flu surge next year: a revival of COVID-19 and a reinstatement of any loosened control measures. ""If we don't get enough people vaccinated over the course of the summer, mainly [because of] vaccine hesitancy,""ù he says, ""we'll get some smaller wave of COVID.""ù  But even as the threat of COVID-19 subsides in future winters, mitigation measures might linger, says Benjamin Singer, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Northwestern University. ""As we start thinking about the balance of all respiratory viruses-COVID, plus flu, plus the others-are we in the United States and in the West going to start thinking more about wearing masks in public in winter months?""ù he wonders.

Annually, ‚âà50""ì100 million cases of dengue are reported worldwide, with 20,000 deaths (1). Aedes mosquitoes and dengue cases were documented in Africa as early as 1823, and cases have since been reported in 34 countries in Africa (2). In Burkina Faso, since the first outbreak in 1925, there have been multiple others (2), including in 2013, 2016, and 2017 (3""ì5). The 2016 outbreak included 1,061 dengue rapid-diagnostic test (RDT) positive cases and 15 deaths in the capital, Ouagadougou, with a reported case-fatality rate (CFR) of 1.2% (4,6). The 2017 outbreak included 5,773 RDT-positive cases and 18 deaths throughout the country, for a CFR of 0.2% (5). These repeated outbreaks suggest a considerable dengue burden in the country.  Despite this burden, data on dengue seroprevalence and force of infection (FOI), the rate at which initial or heterotypic infections are acquired, are scarce in Burkina Faso and Africa (7). In terms of seroprevalence in Burkina Faso, 1 study found the dengue IgG seroprevalence among 683 pregnant women and blood donors to be 26.3% in rural and 36.5% in urban settings in 2003""ì2004 (8). To define DENV transmission in Burkina Faso, we conducted 4 serologic surveys in the same study participants in Ouagadougou during 2015""ì2017. The study targeted 3 objectives. First, we measured seroprevalence of DENV by IgG positivity at enrollment, serosurvey 1 (S1). Second, we estimated age-specific annual FOI, measured by seroconversion in the repeated follow-up surveys (S2""ìS4). Last, because a dengue outbreak occurred in 2016, between the third and fourth serosurveys, we identified and compared demographic and clinical characteristics associated with DENV seroconversion in the outbreak and nonoutbreak periods.  The study protocol received ethics approvals from the institutional review boards of the International Vaccine Institute, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the National Ethical Committee for Health Research of Burkina Faso, and the Ethics Committee of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit√© de Montr√©al at University of Montreal. We obtained written consent forms from each participant >18 years old. For participants 8""ì17 years old, we obtained an assent form from the participant and an informed consent from >1 parent or legal guardian. For participants ‚â§7 years old, we obtained an informed consent from >1 parent or legal guardian.  S1""ìS2 covered the nonoutbreak rainy season in 2015, S2""ìS3 covered the nonoutbreak nonrainy season in 2016, and S3""ìS4 covered the 2016 outbreak. To assess how demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with DENV seroconversion and the difference in patterns in the outbreak (S3""ìS4) compared with those in nonoutbreak periods (S1""ìS2 and S2""ìS3), we compiled a descriptive summary of demographic and clinical characteristics for participants at risk (IgG-negative) at each serosurvey, broken down between participants who had or had not seroconverted by the subsequent serosurvey. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 ( https://www.sas.com ).  For the between-survey analyses, we estimated seroconversion rate ratios (RRs) using binomial regression models with the log time of the actual duration of each participant's interval (i.e., time between consecutive surveys for that person) for potential risk factors, including age, sex, neighborhood, level of education, occupation, any known previous dengue infection, yellow fever (YF) vaccination history, and any self-reported signs and symptoms during the particular interval. As a sensitivity analysis, seroconversion RRs were estimated for consecutive paired results, irrespective of results from other surveys. For example, if a participant was IgG-negative at S2, then IgG-positive at S3, we considered this seroconversion between S2 and S3, even if the person had been IgG-positive at S1.  DENV infection can occur with any of the 4 serotypes and, assuming lifelong acquired homotypic immunity, we estimated the FOI based on IgG seropositivity status ( 15 , 16 ). However, because IgG ELISA tests cannot distinguish among the 4 serotypes, infection in this analysis refers to seroconversion to any DENV serotype ( 15 ). We used binomial regression with a complementary log-log link function ( 17 ""ì 20 ). In part A of the FOI analysis, in which data from the enrollment serosurvey were analyzed, we estimated the average FOI over each participant's lifetime using age as the time at risk. In part B of the FOI analysis, using data from the subset of participants who contributed to all 4 serosurveys, we estimated the FOI between consecutive surveys. We considered participants who were initially seronegative to be at risk for seroconversion and used the interval between consecutive surveys as the time at risk. We provide details of FOI calculations in the Appendix .  We tested samples using a Panbio Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA test (Abbott Diagnostics, https://www.abbott.com ), as described elsewhere ( 9 ). Following the manufacturer's guidelines, we set the IgG threshold for positivity at an index value of 1.1, to detect levels resulting from past or recent infections of any serotype. An index value of 0.9""ì1.1 was classified equivocal (requiring repeated testing), and <0.9 was considered negative. We considered seroconversion of dengue IgG between the pretransmission and posttransmission surveys to result from dengue infection.  We conducted 4 serosurveys, each ‚âà6 months apart. The age-stratified sample of ‚âà3,000 residents 1""ì55 years of age, 80% <35 years of age, reflected the age distribution of the general population of Ouagadougou ( 9 ). In 6 preselected sectors, we randomly selected households on the basis of existing census data; all eligible household members were offered enrollment. To reach the needed sample size, if members of the initially invited household declined, we invited a neighboring household to enroll. We conducted a short interview and collected blood samples ( 9 ). Test results were shared with the participants and we followed the same procedures with the same participants for the 3 subsequent serosurveys.  We selected the study area based on data, including seroprevalence and modeling results, available in the literature and existing research infrastructure ( 9 ""ì 11 ). Ouagadougou is the capital of Burkina Faso in West Africa; most of the population resides in urban settings ( 12 , 13 ). The rainy season is May""ìOctober. The serosurveys were conducted in a defined catchment population of 100,000 residents. The resident population in Ouagadougou is stable, with an annual rate of migration of only 4.1% and >80% of residents owning their homes ( 14 ).  To assess how these variables might be associated with changes in rates of seroconversion, we estimated RRs of seroconversion during the intervals. We found that older age was positively associated with an increased rate of seroconversion. Compared with those 1""ì4 years of age, participants 25""ì55 years of age had higher seroconversion over S1""ìS2 [RR 4.1 (95% CI 1.4""ì15.0)]; both 15""ì24-year-old participants [RR 4.6 (95% CI 1.4""ì17.4)] and 25""ì55-year-old participants [RR 9.1 (95% CI 12.9""ì34.2)] had higher seroconversion over S2""ìS3 ( Table 3 ).  We analyzed data from each pair of surveys, not restricted to data from participants in all 4 surveys, to examine differences in dengue seroconversion during outbreak versus nonoutbreak intervals. During nonoutbreak interval S1""ìS2 (analysis sample = 1,494), 33 (7.3%) of 455 participants at risk (i.e., IgG negative at S1), showed seroconversion. During nonoutbreak interval S2""ìS3 (analysis sample = 1,488), 23 (5.2%) of 443 participants at risk (i.e., IgG negative at S2), showed seroconversion. During outbreak interval S3""ìS4 (analysis sample = 1,401) 78 (17.1%) of 455 participants at risk (i.e., IgG negative at S3), showed seroconversion. We compiled demographic and clinical characteristics of participants with IgG seroconversion compared with participants who remained IgG negative during each interval ( Table 2 ).  In part B, we calculated annualized FOI among participants who had been IgG negative at the preceding serosurvey using binomial regression with the intersurvey interval, calculated in years, as the time at risk. For the interval S1""ìS2, FOI per year was 14.0% (95% CI 9.5%""ì18.4%); for the interval S2""ìS3, 9.6% (95% CI 5.4%""ì13.8%); and for the interval S3""ìS4, 20.3% (95% CI 16.1%""ì24.5%) ( Figure 1 ). The mean duration was 0.53 years (‚âà6 months) for interval S1""ìS2; 0.44 years for S2""ìS3; and 0.84 years for S3""ìS4. Age-specific annual FOIs were calculated and older age groups with <5 seronegative participants were merged. For intervals S1""ìS2 and S2""ìS3, FOI was higher for older participants ( Figure 1 ). For interval S3""ìS4, high FOIs of 30% per year were found in participants 15""ì19 and 25""ì29 years of age.  Based on data from the 2,897 participants with complete information, 82% of 1""ì4-year-olds and 65% of 5""ì9-year-olds were IgG negative and therefore at risk of infection at the start of the study ( Table 1 ). IgG positivity increased with age, so that by age 26, IgG positivity reached 80% ( Figure 2 ). The binomial regression based on IgG positivity by age at enrollment, assuming the FOI was constant over ages and calendar time (part A), resulted in an annual FOI of 5.95% (95% CI 5.66""ì6.24) ( Figure 2 ).  We obtained complete demographic (age and neighborhood) and laboratory data for 2,897 of 3,026 participants ( Figure 1 ). At enrollment (S1), in June 2015, 1,920 (66.3%) of 2,897 participants were IgG positive. At S2, in December 2015, 1,417 (67.2%) of 2,109 participants were IgG positive. At S3, in May 2016, 1,400 (66.5%) of 2,106 participants were IgG positive. At S4, in March 2017, 1,121 (67.9%) of 1,651 participants were IgG positive.  Discussion  Our study provides data on population-based seroprevalence and rates of DENV seroconversion that may help with assessing the largely undocumented burden of dengue fever in Africa. The dengue burden in Africa has been conjectured to be similar to that in the Americas but has been largely unrecognized and masked by other illnesses with similar symptoms (21,22). In particular, the major strength of this study was that we longitudinally followed the same participants using 4 repeated serosurveys to measure the FOI of dengue in Burkina Faso.  Although IgG ELISA test results might be influenced by cross-reactivity with different flaviviruses, our estimate of seroprevalence was comparable to prevalence estimates from other studies, all tested using IgG ELISA: 61% of participants 1""ì65 years of age in Colombia (25); 83.1% in participants 15""ì19 years of age in Tahiti (26); 74% in participants in a low socioeconomic area in Recife, Brazil (27); and 68.7% in participants in Salvador, Brazil (28). The overall proportion of IgG-positive participants remained similar across the surveys, although it was highest at S4 (68%). The small increase in seropositivity despite an outbreak between S3 and S4 may have resulted from different participants being lost to follow-up at each consecutive survey. Such losses were substantial during the S1""ìS2 and S3""ìS4 intervals. The mean age of participants lost during S1""ìS2 was 20.7 years (95% CI 19.3""ì22.0) and was 23.7 (95% CI: 22.5""ì24.9) during S3""ìS4. The mean age of the participants was 22.2 years (95% CI 21.6""ì22.9) during S1""ìS2 and 21.6 (95% CI 21.0""ì22.2) during S3""ìS4. For S1""ìS2, the mean age was not significantly different between nonparticipants and remaining participants, but lost participants were significantly older for S3""ìS4; participants lost at follow-up might have tended to be IgG positive, plausibly resulting in underestimating IgG positivity at the follow-up survey. While decreasing representativeness is a limitation, we based FOI calculations on seroconversion meaning they likely would not have been substantially affected. We found apparent seroreversion from seropositive to seronegative in <3% of the paired samples: 29 during S1""ìS2, 14 during S2""ìS3; and 38 during S3""ìS4. However, we could not distinguish whether such cases were due to test errors or waning immunity.  Data from the baseline serosurvey in this study (part A) resulted in an annual FOI of 6.0%, although this assumes that it was constant over age and calendar time. This finding is comparable with estimates from other regions, such as Sri Lanka at 14% per year (15); Colombia at 8.7% (22); and a low socioeconomic area in Recife, Brazil, at 5.3% (25). Our model seems to capture the increase in baseline seroprevalence with age (Figure 1). However, any given age profile in a cross-sectional study can result from different combinations of incidence varying over age or over calendar time (27). Therefore, the estimated FOI from the baseline survey is subject to more limitations than FOIs estimated from the paired surveys. Nonetheless, our data support that dengue may be a bigger public health problem in Africa than is currently recognized.  From the repeat surveys (part B) for which we knew the exact duration of the intervals, we could measure the FOI more directly without assuming a constant value over age, providing a more accurate estimate of the magnitude of transmission. These estimates were higher than the 6% annual FOI based on the enrollment survey. Among 1,269 participants with IgG results from all 4 serosurveys, annual FOIs were 14% for S1""ìS2, 10% for S2""ìS3, and 20% for S3""ìS4. Testing of paired samples showed that 7.3% (33/455) seroconverted during S1""ìS2, 5.2% (23/443) during S2""ìS3, and 17.1% (78/455) during S3""ìS4. As we expected, the annualized estimates of rates were ‚âà2 times the simple proportions for the first 2 intervals. For the third interval (S3""ìS4), the annualized FOI was ‚âà1.5 times (12/8 months) the proportion seroconverting, because the conversion between proportions and rates is less linear for higher values.  The paired survey analyses did not require an assumption of constant FOI before the study and showed that FOI varied markedly across time within the study. In particular, a high annualized FOI (20%) was observed between S3""ìS4, coinciding with a major outbreak. However, even during nonoutbreak intervals, we found considerable dengue transmission; annualized FOIs ranged from 10% (in a nonrainy season, such as S2""ìS3) to 14% (in a rainy season, S1""ìS2) (28). Little comparable information from the region is available, but these rates are comparable to the 8.7% per year reported from Colombia (23).  These annual rates of infection, measured by seroconversion, may include both initial and subsequent heterotypic infection, because these are indistinguishable by IgG ELISA. However, in our analysis, the influence of past infection is minimal, because we focused on participants with IgG-negative status at enrollment for calculations of FOIs between surveys. This study was unable to distinguish participants with single or multiple infections during the study period. Furthermore, among those with multiple infections, cyclical dominance among DENV serotypes is observed in regions with better-documented dengue endemicity (29,30). However, cocirculation of multiple DENV serotypes in Burkina Faso has yet to be fully demonstrated. Thus, in our study, we calculated an overall FOI, for the totality of serotypes (20,31). Still, we recognize the need for more in-depth analyses using neutralization assays to understand serotype-specific transmission patterns in Africa.  In part B of the study, without having to assume that risk is constant over age, we found that FOI was higher in older than in younger participants, although these findings are based on small numbers, given that most people had already seroconverted at younger ages. FOI increased with age in the intervals of the nonoutbreak times (S1""ìS2 and S2""ìS3), which has also been found in Colombia (23). Our data are from IgG seroconversion rather than clinical dengue, but incidence of dengue fever in the 2016 outbreak in Burkina Faso was also higher among teenagers and young adults (4,6,32). In contrast, in the outbreak interval S3""ìS4, the FOI was similar across ages (13%""ì34%), possibly suggesting the emergence of a different serotype with little preexisting population immunity (20). Without much data on serotype-specific DENV incidence in Burkina Faso, previous studies and reports of ministry of health and World Health Organization investigations suggest that the 2016 outbreak was mainly caused by DENV-2 (4,6,32).  Myalgia during S1""ìS2, arthralgia during S2""ìS3, and fatigue during S3""ìS4 were positively associated with seroconversion with statistical significance. Whereas cases of seroconversion may have been associated with either mild or subclinical illnesses, participants were asked whether they had experienced these symptoms in the interval since the previous survey. These symptoms are common in dengue illness; myalgia and arthralgia were listed in the 1997 World Health Organization dengue case classifications, and fatigue or lethargy in 2009 classifications (33""ì35). However, because these self-reported symptoms were recorded at intervals of 6""ì8 months, without prompt investigation to identify a cause, we cannot conclude that any associations with seroconversion are causal.  This study is subject to several limitations. First, the generalizability of this study is limited by participants all being recruited from the urban population in the capital city. The magnitude and patterns of DENV transmission may differ in other regions of Burkina Faso, including rural areas, with different age profiles, ecologic settings, or socioeconomic conditions. Also, although a large number of participants (1,269) participated in all 4 serosurveys, a substantial number of original participants missed surveys. Those participants who missed >1 surveys were more likely to be older than those who participated in all surveys. This shortfall could have led us to underestimate prevalence.  Second, our results were based on serologic testing using IgG ELISA. Further analyses using neutralization assays are planned, but no confirmatory testing was applied to verify the IgG results. For estimating dengue FOI, serologic cross-reaction with other flaviviruses affecting the observed dengue IgG rates is a commonly reported limitation (36,37). Ultimately, this limitation could result in inaccurate seroprevalence and FOI estimates because antibodies against nondengue flaviviruses could have been detected (15,38). In particular, Zika virus has been reported in Burkina Faso (39,40), as have outbreaks of YF in 1998, 2003, and 2004 (41""ì43). Vaccine-induced YF antibodies could also result in interference with the specificity of IgG ELISA (38). In our data, at each of the serosurveys, <5% of participants answered that they had received YF vaccination; although subject to recall bias, this rate is much lower than the coverage rate of 85% reported by the Expanded Program on Immunization in 2007 (42). Using self-reported YF vaccination history as a proxy for YF virus seropositivity, we found no difference in IgG positivity between participants reporting and not reporting vaccination, a finding supported by others (38,44).  Despite the possible effect of cross-reactivity on dengue ELISAs, 2 studies reported a concordance level of 99% between the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and dengue IgG results (37,45). Also, when IgG ELISA results were verified by using serologic data among 13,661 participants from 13 countries to estimate dengue FOI, IgG ELISA results were confirmed by 50% PRNT in >97% of the IgG-positive samples (20). Samples from 277 healthy adults in a rural district in Malaysia were tested with the same ELISA test used in our study, and PRNT was performed on a subset of IgG-positive samples (46). Evidence of past infection was found in 75.5% (209/277) of participants and, of 96 samples randomly selected to undergo PRNT testing, all 96 were dengue-confirmed with >50% plaque reduction for DENV and showed that the detected antibodies were specific to dengue virus (46).  The sensitivity of this commercial DENV IgG indirect ELISA was reported as 99.2% and the specificity as 96.2% when compared with the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) method (47). A study compared performance of IgG ELISA to that of HI testing in a serosurvey of 327 children in Tahiti and reported sensitivity and specificity, as well as agreement between the 2 tests, to be >83% for all DENV serotypes (24). Another study reported 90.9% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity of the IgG indirect ELISA when compared with HI, also with a high correlation between the tests (48). Whereas those data are from outside of Africa, where a different and unknown composition of flaviviruses may be circulating, the results indicate a high degree of agreement between IgG ELISA and more confirmatory and better validated tests, such as HI and PRNT.  If cross-reactivity across other flaviviruses were to result in misclassifications, leading to a high rate of false positives, our findings would be overestimates of the true disease prevalence and FOI. However, given the high concordance between IgG and PRNT or HI assay results based on available data and because we analyzed data from paired serosurveys of participants who were IgG negative at enrollment, we believe that our results were minimally affected by this issue.  In conclusion, our estimates of both seroprevalence and FOI were comparable with those from dengue-endemic countries in the Americas. Repeated outbreaks indicate a considerable level of DENV transmission in Ouagadougou, but the extent of transmission and hyperendemicity needs to be further verified. Specifically, additional longitudinal evaluation with confirmatory tests and linked clinical evaluation of dengue fever in the general population in the region would be necessary to further validate our findings. Seroprevalence and FOI are important factors to be considered when making evidence-based decisions to implement interventions for prevention and control, including vaccine introduction. In the absence of other reliable data, our findings on dengue seroprevalence and FOI based on consecutive serosurveys provide practical evidence that could be used to support policy decisions.","fever, dengue",What disease is this article about?,Dengue Fever,How many cases are reported worldwide?,100 million,How many people die from dengue fever worldwide?,"20,000",What are the risk factors for dengue fever?,"age, sex, neighborhood, level of education, occupation, any known previous dengue infection, yellow fever (YF) vaccination history, and any self-reported signs and symptoms during the particular interval"

Seethamchai)  Suggested citation for this article  Among 1,180 symptomatic malaria patients, 9 (0.76%) infected with Plasmodium cynomolgi were co-infected with P. vivax (n = 7), P. falciparum (n = 1), or P. vivax and P. knowlesi (n = 1). Patients were from Tak, Chanthaburi, Ubon Ratchathani, Yala, and Narathiwat Provinces, suggesting P. cynomolgi is widespread in this country.  Plasmodium cynomolgi, a simian malaria parasite, possesses biological and genetic characteristics akin to those of the most widespread human malaria parasite, P. vivax. Although P. cynomolgi circulates among monkey species such as long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina), experimental and accidental transmissions have been implicated in symptomatic infections in humans (1). Several mosquito vectors for human malaria can also transmit P. cynomolgi, posing the risk of cross-species transmission in areas where its natural hosts coexist with people (1,2). Among pig-tailed and long-tailed macaques living in various countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, P. cynomolgi infections are not uncommon (3,4). A case of naturally transmitted P. cynomolgi malaria in a human was reported from eastern Malaysia (5). Subsequent surveillance in western Cambodia and northern Sabah state in Malaysia revealed asymptomatic human infection, albeit at low prevalence (6,7). Symptomatic P. cynomolgi infection was diagnosed in a traveler returning to Denmark from Southeast Asia (8). During testing of symptomatic malaria patients in Thailand, we identified 9 co-infected with cryptic P. cynomolgi and other Plasmodium species.  The Study We examined 1,359 blood samples taken from febrile patients who sought treatment at malaria clinics or local hospitals in 5 Thailand provinces: Tak (n = 192, during 2007""ì2013), Ubon Ratchathani (n = 239, during 2014""ì2016), Chanthaburi (n = 144, during 2009), Yala (n = 592, during 2008""ì2018), and Narathiwat (n = 192, during 2008""ì2010). Using microscopy, we found 1,152 cases in which malaria was caused by P. vivax (869 patients, 75.43%), P. falciparum (272 patients, 23.61%), or co-infection with both species (11 patients, 0.96%). Using species-specific nested PCR, including for P. cynomolgi (Appendix), targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mtCytb) of 5 human malaria species for molecular detection, as described elsewhere (9,10), we found malaria in 1,180 patients; P. vivax infections exceeded P. falciparum infections (Table 1). Submicroscopic parasitemia occurred in 28/1,180 (2.4%) patients: 19 infected with P. vivax, 7 with P. falciparum, 1 with P. vivax and P. falciparum, and 1 with P. malariae. The mean age of all patients was 26.3 (range 7""ì85) years; 940/1,180 (79.7%) of patients were men. Febrile symptoms, lasting 1""ì7 days (mean 3.1, SD ¬±1.3 days) before blood sample collection, developed in all PCR-positive malaria patients. Monoinfection with P. knowlesi occurred in 4 patients, P. malariae in 3, and P. ovale in 1. We detected co-infections in 77 (0.93%) patients; of these co-infections, 55 were P. falciparum and P. vivax. In total (i.e., including both monoinfections and co-infections), P. knowlesi was detected in 18 patients, of which 10 cases were newly identified from Ubon Ratchathani Province, which borders Cambodia and Laos. We detected P. cynomolgi in 9 patients, all of whom were co-infected with P. vivax (n = 7), P. falciparum (n = 1), or both P. vivax and P. knowlesi (n = 1). The overall prevalence of P. cynomolgi infections was 0.76%. Patients infected with P. cynomolgi were found in all provinces. Although 5 of these patients were from Yala province, the proportion of P. cynomolgi infections among malaria cases in each malaria-endemic area (0.52%""ì0.87%) was comparable. Figure DNA from 10 P. knowlesi isolates from Ubon Ratchathani Province and the 9 P. cynomolgi isolates were subject to nested PCR amplification spanning a 1,318-bp region of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I (mtCOX1). Direct sequencing of the purified PCR-amplified template was successfully performed from all 10 P. knowlesi and from 6 P. cynomolgi isolates. The remaining 3 P. cynomolgi isolates could not be further amplified due to inadequate DNA in the samples. All mtCOX1 sequences of P. knowlesi from Ubon Ratchathani Province were different from one another and distinct from those from the previous case of natural human infection in Thailand (GenBank accession no. AY598141) (11). All 6 amplified P. cynomolgi isolates contained different sequences belonging to 2 clades. One was closely related to the Gombak strain (accession no. AB444129) and the remaining 5 isolates were clustered with the RO strain (accession no. AB444126) (Figure). All but 1 P. cynomolgi infection occurred in male patients (age 15""ì53 years, median 32 years). Most P. cynomolgi malaria patients resided in areas where domesticated or wild macaques were living in proximity to humans. Infections with P. cynomolgi occurred in different annual periods; more cases were detected in rainy seasons than in dry seasons (Table 2). The parasite density of P. cynomolgi could not be determined from blood smears because of morphologic resemblance to P. vivax; an isolate co-infected with P. falciparum (YL3634) had very low parasitemia. Of 8 patients with P. cynomolgi co-infection, 6 had parasitemia <10,000 parasites/ŒºL (<0.2% parasitemia). It remains unknown whether P. cynomolgi was co-responsible for symptomatic infections or merely coexisted asymptomatically with other human malaria parasites. However, self-reported defervescence among P. cynomolgi""ìco-infected patients occurred 1""ì3 days after antimalarial treatment with chloroquine plus primaquine after onsite microscopic diagnosis of P. vivax malaria or artesunate plus mefloquine for P. falciparum malaria. Unfortunately, data on long-term follow-up were not available.  Conclusions This report highlights the presence of P. cynomolgi in the human population of Thailand, where natural hosts, both pig-tailed and long-tailed macaques, are prevalent. All patients with P. cynomolgi infections harbored either P. falciparum or P. vivax in their blood, implying that this simian malaria species could share the same anopheline vectors or have different vectors with similar anthropophilic and zoophilic tendencies. The presence of P. cynomolgi in diverse malaria-endemic areas of Thailand suggests that cross-species transmission has occurred. Human infection with P. cynomolgi seem not to be newly emerging because it was detected among blood samples collected over a range of time periods since 2007. Undoubtedly, morphologic similarity between P. cynomolgi and P. vivax can hamper conventional microscopic diagnosis (1,5,8). Cryptic co-existence of simian and human malaria species could further preclude accurate molecular detection when inadequate diagnostic devices are used. Previous surveys of Plasmodium infections in pig-tailed and long-tailed macaques have revealed the presence of P. cynomolgi and other simian malaria species in Thailand, mainly in the southern part of the country (4). Most patients infected with P. cynomolgi resided in areas where macaques were living in proximity to humans; therefore, the risk of acquiring malaria from this parasite could increase as people encroach into the habitats of infected macaques, as happened with malaria caused by P. knowlesi. Of note, co-infection with P. cynomolgi, P. knowlesi, and P. vivax occurred in a patient in Yala Province whose housing area was surrounded by several domesticated pig-tailed and long-tailed macaques. Analysis of the mtCOX1 sequences of P. cynomolgi among 6 patients showed that all isolates possessed different genetic sequences, suggesting that several strains or clones of this simian parasite are capable of cross-transmission from macaques to humans. Meanwhile, P. cynomolgi seems to contain 2 divergent lineages (12), represented by RO and Gombak strains. The mtCOX1 sequences of both P. cynomolgi lineages were found in human-derived isolates in this study, further supporting that diverse strains of this parasite can infect people. Likewise, sequence diversity in the mtCOX1 of P. knowlesi from Ubon Ratchathani Province suggests that cross-transmission from macaques to humans may not be restricted to particular parasite strains. Although human malaria from either parasite may be asymptomatic, infection with P. knowlesi can result in death, but patients infected with P. cynomolgi at worst had only benign symptoms (5""ì8). However, severe and complicated malaria has been observed in rhesus macaques experimentally infected with P. cynomolgi (13). Whether severe cynomolgi malaria can occur in humans remains to be elucidated. However, if human infections with P. cynomolgi do become public health problems, diagnostic and control measures might be complicated by the morphological similarity between P. vivax and P. cynomolgi.

Studies in Malaysia first identified An. hackeri as the vector of P. knowlesi [4]. However, this species is so highly zoophilic that it has been considered impossible that it could infect humans [5]. After the recognition of the importance of P. knowlesi malaria in humans in Sarawak, vector studies were conducted in different ecological niches. In Kapit district, Anopheles latens was identified as the main natural vector of P. knowlesi for both macaques and humans [67], while in Sabah, Anopheles balabacensis was incriminated [68,69]. In both states, these 2 species, belonging to the Leucosphyrus group, are also vectors of human malaria [16].  In Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia, Anopheles cracens, a more anthropophilic member of the Leucosphyrus group was identified as the vector of P. knowlesi [70], while in Selangor, An. hackeri and Anopheles introlatus were found to be the vectors [4,71]. It seems that different geographical locations have a different predominant species of Leucosphyrus group. Within the same area, different ecological conditions play an important role. In Kapit, Sarawak An. latens and Anopheles watsonii were predominant in forested ecotypes, while in the farm areas, Anopheles donaldi and An. latens were the main species [67]. However, dissection and further examination of those mosquitoes revealed only An. latens to be positive with sporozoites and to be attracted to both humans and macaques. Thus, An. latens had been incriminated as the main vector for P. knowlesi in Kapit, Sarawak. The role of ecology was also observed by Wharton and Eyles, who incriminated An. hackeri as a vector for P. knowlesi at the coastal region of Selangor [4].  Other species of Anopheles like An. watsonii and An. donaldi found in sympatry with An. latens in Kapit were positive for oocysts with PCR""ìpositive for the genus Plasmodium, but species identification by using primers for simian and human malaria parasites was not successful [67]. Anopheles kochi in Kuala Lipis, Pahang was found in considerable numbers in monkey baited traps but was not positive for oocyst or sporozoites by dissection [70]. A recent study by Hawkes and colleagues in Sabah found a non-Leucosphyrus group species, An. donaldi, to be positive for DNA of P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi, and an unknown Plasmodium species [72]. Unfortunately, in this study, the whole mosquito was processed, so it is not known whether oocysts or sporozoites were present, and therefore, whether these mosquitoes were vectors.  In the forest and forest fringes of Khanh Phu commune, Vietnam, Anopheles dirus, the main vector of human malaria in this region [73], was identified as the primary vector of P. knowlesi [66]. It was the only Anopheles species found with sporozoites, and the highest number infected was detected in the forest compared to the forest fringes. P. knowlesi was the second most common Plasmodium species identified in the vectors using nested PCR assay followed by other simian plasmodia [66]. P. knowlesi was detected in the salivary glands of An. dirus as was the case in the previous study by Marchand and colleagues in the same locality [42].  In the other countries of the Mekong region (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand), An. dirus is the main vector for human malaria besides Anopheles minimus [73]. Thus, based on results from Vietnam, it can be extrapolated that An. dirus could play a role in the transmission of knowlesi malaria in that region. In Palawan, Phillipines, Tsukamoto and colleagues demonstrated the presence of Plasmodium oocysts and sporozoites in An. balabacensis in an area where macaques were present. At that time, molecular tools were not available, so they carried out experiments to expose An. balabacensis, also a member of the Leucosphyrus group, to Plasmodium-positive macaques and showed that An. balabacensis could develop sporozoites [60]. In conclusion, it can be stated that, at present, only the Leucosphyrus group of Anopheles are confirmed vectors for P. knowlesi in Southeast Asia.",malaria,,,,,,,,

For many the year 2020 will go down as one of the darkest in living memory. But amid the tumult sparked by the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic crisis, there was the rare piece of good news to bring a bit of cheer. Here are 10 feel-good items from what has generally been seen as an annus horribilis.  Advertising Read more  1. Vaccines developed to halt Covid-19  It was the year of the lightning-fast vaccine. ¬© Joel Saget, AFP/Archives  The dawn of the coronavirus crisis that would go on to spread around the world immediately touched off a global race to find a vaccine. That unprecedented endeavour, built on international cooperation, concluded with a number of the precious serums being administered to those most vulnerable to Covid-19 in France and the rest of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Russia before the year was out. No vaccine in history has ever been developed so rapidly.  As a bonus, the research deployed towards coronavirus vaccines also provided a boost in the development of treatments based on synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA). First developed in the 1970s, the technique could be used to fight certain types of cancer.  2. Lockdowns lead to better air quality  The weather balloon run by Airparif, the organisation responsible for monitoring the air quality in the greater Paris area, flies over the French capital on May 7, 2020, during France's first Covid-19 lockdown. ¬© Joel Saget, AFP  Much of humanity breathed better air in 2020. The slowdown and stoppage of sectors of the economy as the world locked down to fight the pandemic allowed for reductions in air pollution in multiple countries. As early as February, NASA satellite images illustrated a drastic drop in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is mainly produced by vehicles and thermal power plants, in Wuhan, the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In its annual report, the United Nations Environment Programme said reductions in industrial activity, electricity production and travel should result in a 7 percent drop in emissions in 2020. The good news should be tempered, however, by the fact that even reductions of that magnitude will only mean a 0.01¬∞C drop by 2050 as global temperatures continue to rise.  3. The unstoppable rise of the bicycle in France and Europe  Cyclists travel in the cycle lane along the Embankment in central London on May 16, 2020, following an easing of lockdown rules in England during the novel coronavirus pandemic. ¬© Justin Tallis, AFP  Good for health and good for the planet, cycling took centre stage in 2020, the year of the bike. In 2019, nearly 4 out of 10 urban professionals said they rode a bicycle to work. That trend accelerated markedly this year in France. From the French pension reform strikes that made getting to work a headache for many early in the year to the pandemic that changed office life as we know it, many big-city residents began pedalling for their commute and for local journeys. The number of cyclists rose more than 200 percent in 2020 on certain routes in large French cities, according to Strava, a smartphone app for cyclists and pedestrians.  Indeed, the trend extends to all of Europe. In the Netherlands, already a cycling hotspot, bicycle sales exploded amid the pandemic, drawing comparisons to the run on toilet paper that characterised coronavirus lockdowns early on. In Belgium, bicycle usage rose by 69 percent, according to Google Maps statistics. In London, cycling increased so much that Mayor Sadiq Khan pledged to quadruple the number of bike paths in the British capital.  4. Polio officially eradicated on the African continent  A polio campaigner smiles during a polio vaccination exercise in Maiduguri, Nigeria, on August 27, 2016. ¬© Sunday Alamba, AP/File  While the world's attention was hanging on the coronavirus crisis, the battle against poliomyelitis was quietly won in Africa: The World Health Organization officially declared wild polio eradicated in Africa on August 25. ""Ending wild polio virus in Africa is one of the greatest public health achievements of our time and provides powerful inspiration for all of us to finish the job of eradicating polio globally,""ù declared WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The virus used to paralyse an estimated 75,000 children annually across the continent.  5. Hostages freed  Sophie P√©tronin upon her arrival in Bamako, Mali, on October 8, 2020. ¬© AFP  A number of hostages were released from their captivity in 2020. Three French nationals and one Iraqi working for the SOS Chr√©tiens d'Orient NGO, who had been abducted on January 20 in Baghdad, found freedom on March 26. Those who kidnapped Antoine Brochon, Julien Dittmar, Alexandre Goodarzy and Tariq Mattoka remain unknown, but the abduction is thought to have been carried out by a Shiite militia close to the powers that be in Iraq and Iran.  Meanwhile in Iran, Roland Marchal, a specialist in the conflicts of sub-Saharan Africa, was released on March 21 after a prisoner swap between Paris and Tehran. Marchal had been detained in Iran since June 2019 along with the Franco-Iranian anthropologist Fariba Adelkhah, a researcher at France's Centre for International Research (CERI-Sciences Po). Adelkhah, for her part, was released temporarily from prison; she remains in Tehran with her family, monitored via an electronic tag.  Aid worker Sophie P√©tronin, who was the world's last remaining French hostage in 2020, was finally released on October 8, nearly four years after her abduction by gunmen in Gao, northern Mali, on Christmas Eve in 2016. P√©tronin, who was the head of a small children's charity in the country, was freed alongside opposition leader Souma√Øla Ciss√© and two Italian nationals in exchange for 200 jailed militants released to Malian jihadists.  6. Some good news for rare and endangered species  A baby pangolin on its mother's back at a zoo in India in 2001. Reuters  There were also some encouraging signs for animals at risk of extinction throughout 2020. In Asia the pangolin was withdrawn from the pharmacopoeia of traditional Chinese medicines, which had ascribed virtues to the animal's scales. An estimated 200,000 of the creatures are pulled from the wild every year. In recent months, China has more broadly forbidden the use of wild animals for consumption as food, citing a risk of transmissible disease to humans, but the market remains legal for scientific research and traditional medicine.  In Africa, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature announced on March 19 that the African black rhino, a critically endangered species, is doing a little better this year than it was eight years ago. Their population numbers have risen from 4,845 in 2012 to 5,630 this year.  For the first time since January, biologists on an expedition on Kangaroo Island, Australia, observed a zebra-tailed little pygmy possum (Cercartetus lepidus) after they thought the species had been rendered extinct by the monumental bushfires that had raged in the country in late 2019 and early 2020. The 10-centimetre-long marsupial is the smallest of the known pygmy possums.  France has also had good news on the at-risk species front. The ibex made its triumphant return to the French Pyr√©n√©es, the crowning achievement of a long Franco-Spanish project. More than a century after the mountain sheep disappeared from the region, a new generation of 70 kids was registered in 2020.  7. Egypt puts an end to animal rides  Mask-clad camel guides stand by their camels near the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) at the Giza Pyramids necropolis on the southwestern outskirts of the Egyptian capital Cairo on July 1, 2020. ¬© Khaled Desoukik, AFP  More good news for our animal friends. After elephant rides were banned at the Angkor Wat monument in Cambodia in 2019, Egypt has now banned camel rides near the tourist sites at the pyramids of Giza.  In France, animal rights campaigners notched another victory with news that wild animals would be ""gradually"" forbidden in travelling circuses in the country. Environment Minister Barbara Pompili also announced on September 29 that the reproduction and introduction of new orca whales and dolphins at France's three dolphinariums would be banned.  8. Brazil's footballing women score one for equal pay  Brazil's Marta Silva (hidden) is congratulated by teammates after scoring a goal during a football match against Canada in Calais, northern France, on March 10, 2020. ¬© Denis Charlet, AFP  ""There is no more gender difference,"" the president of the Brazilian football confederation told a press conference on September 2. The national women's team players in the football-mad country will now be paid ""the same amount for prize money and daily rates"" as their male counterparts.  Equal pay remains a distant dream for many women playing in clubs and national teams elsewhere, where salaries display dizzying gaps. Some, such as the US women's national team, have of late sought to rectify the disparity in court.  9. French start-up discovers enzyme that can recycle plastic ad infinitum  A technician oversees a chemical manipulation on a Carbios reactor at the premises of Carbios, in Saint-Beauzire, central-southern France, on April 1, 2019. ¬© Thierry Zoccolan, AFP  A firm based in Clermont-Ferrand, central France, has developed a revolutionary technology that will allow for the limitless recycling of polyethylene terephthalate, commonly known as PET, which represents more than half of all plastics used worldwide. The researchers announced the discovery of an enzyme on February 27, 2019. This year they modified it in a laboratory with the assistance of three scientific institutes (Insa Toulouse, Inrae and CNRS) to create a molecular champion of plastic absorption.  Since then, the company has built an industrial demonstrator outside Lyon that can recycle 2,000 tonnes of PET and that will be operational in 2021. The start-up firm is slated to build an enormous European plant in two years' time with the capacity to recycle 100,000 tonnes per year and another 10 plants throughout the world by 2030.  10. Lockdowns open doors for new forms of artistic performance  Bob Dylan Fred Tanneau, AFP  Many artists around the world who were deprived of the stage by the coronavirus pandemic took to performing virtual concerts in 2020. Global stars like Metallica, Kylie Minogue and Boy George could offer up fresh performances via social media and innovate ahead of their return to the physical stage when the crisis ends. French musicians including M, Keren Ann and Christine and the Queens offered free concerts for their fans. The shows represented a boon for less wealthy fans, who could catch their favourite artists in concert from their living rooms.  Lockdowns also appear to have inspired some of the greats. Legendary US singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, for one, who hadn't put out a new original single in eight years, offered his fans a 17-minute song, ""Murder Most Foul"", back in March.

Addressing the Overseas S&T Minister and Diplomats Conclave at the India International Science Festival, Vardhan said as many as 51 startup-driven innovative products are being financially supported to accelerate their market readiness and deployment.  A special call has been made through the Technology Development Board to support industries that have an appropriate and proven product or technology to commercialise or scale-up further, Vardhan said.  ""The crisis has stimulated innovation and enterprise in India. A comprehensive mapping of the entire start-up ecosystem has been done to identify and support relevant technology solutions ready for scale-up,"" the minister said.  Abas Basir, Minister of Higher Education, Afghanistan; Chhem Kieth Rethy, Minister Delegate attached to the Prime Minister and Secretary of State, Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology & Innovation, Cambodia; Myo Thein Gyi, Minister of Education, Myanmar; Fortunato T De La Pe≈àa, Secretary (Minister) of Science and Technology, Philippines; Seetha Arrambepola, Minister of Skill Development, Vocational Education, Research Innovation, Sri Lanka; and lbrokhim Yu Abdurakhmonov Minister of Innovative Development, Uzbekistan attended the event virtually.  COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine - one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show  Vardhan, who is also the Union health minister, said India''s response to the pandemic has been driven by the wisdom and evidence of science.  ""We have drawn lessons at every stage and we have not hesitated to accept the advice of our doctors and scientists or to adopt global best practices,"" he said.  COVID-19 created a spike in demand for pharmaceuticals, especially hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol. Recently, the announcement of USD 10 million towards a COVID-19 emergency fund by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was used to send drugs, medical supplies, and machines to our neighbouring countries like Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka, Vardhan said.  During the current pandemic, India has already supplied anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and paracetamol to more than 60 coronavirus-hit countries, he said.  ""Today, the focus has shifted to vaccine production and rapid testing. Many vaccines are in the advanced stage of development and India is slated to become one of the largest manufacturers of vaccines in the world. India is deeply involved in many international collaborations and initiatives,"" he said.  Under the Partnerships for Accelerating Clinical Trials (PACT), capacity building activities for facilitating phase III clinical trials of Indian COVID vaccines with partnering nations are being supported. Three training modules with nearly eight sessions have been successfully completed for 100 participants from Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the minister said.",malaria,,,,,,,,

Its occupants were aware of the urgency of their special mission that had started at the National Institute of Virology, Pune. However, despite the empty roads, the driver of the four-wheeler had to be careful. He could not afford an accident; the stakes were sky-high.In the vehicle was a container with a live strain of the coronavirus in deep freeze. Its destination: the Bharat Biotech laboratory in Hyderabad. Eight months later, the biotechnology company announced a vaccine, after researching on such strains, that promises to protect us from Covid-19 However, this journey has come with its pitfalls. The latest, and the most public, was seen after the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on January 3 approved the Covid-19 vaccines of Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech for restricted use. While SII's Covishield was developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is India's first indigenous coronavirus vaccine.The DCGI's approval of Covaxin, despite it not having phase-3 clinical trial efficacy and safety data, stunned several vaccine experts. Many expressed doubts about the company's clinical trial processes. In a television interview, Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla said only three vaccines - those engineered by Pfizer Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca - would work. ""Everything else has been proven to be safe, just like water,""ù he had said.A moment of triumph became a defensive one for Bharat Biotech's founder-CMD M Krishna Ella . ""Some companies have branded me like ""òwater'. I want to deny that. We are scientists,""ù an apparently upset Ella said at a press conference the next day. According to sources, senior government officials had to intervene to bring about a truce between the two companies. Despite repeated attempts, Bharat Biotech did not respond to ET Magazine's queries. Ella could not be reached over the phone.People who know Ella say he is a soft-spoken man. But the ""safe like water""ù comment apparently did not go down well with him. ""Am not surprised with Ella's outburst,""ù says a Hyderabad-based pharma entrepreneur, requesting anonymity. ""He is very passionate about his work. He is a scientist at heart. You got to give it to that guy because he engineered that vaccine himself. He was not a contractmanufacturer for some foreign lab.""ùIf Covaxin succeeds, it will cement Bharat Biotech as a formidable drug manufacturer in the world. The Hyderabad-based company that Krishna Ella founded with his wife Suchitra already has an enviable body of work. In fact, mass production of the rotavirus vaccine first by Bharat Biotech and then by SII emboldened the government to include the vaccine in its national immunisation schedule in 2019. It had to pay a fraction of the US dollar to bulk purchase the vaccine from these manufacturers.Bharat Biotech's Rotavac became an obvious choice for various governments, multilateral agencies, local bodies and private medical healthcare facilities as it was ""prequalified""ù by the World Health Organization eight months before Serum's Rotasiil. Five drops of the pink rotavirus vaccine delivered orally to babies three times in the first 14 weeks help cut infant mortality considerably. WHO says 90,000""ì153,000 children die from rotavirus infection in India each year ""but these numbers are not based on nationally representative samples""ù. However, medical experts and doctors say the rotavirus vaccine has helped to reduce infant mortality across India.The success of Rotavac positioned Bharat Biotech as a ""small challenger""ù to Pune-based SII, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer. The strategic guidance Bharat Biotech (BB) gets is also a reason for its rise, says the pharma practice head of a large consulting firm. ""BB is more unique in its approach to vaccines. Their pick of diseases that need vaccination make them betterplaced - and more agile - than Serum. BB is purely a science and scientist-led company.""ù That shows Ella is a scientist as well as a businessman.Before establishing Bharat Biotech in 1996 with a seed capital of Rs 12 crore, Ella taught at The Medical University in South Carolina. Two years after starting Bharat Biotech with his wife Suchitra, Ella rolled out a ""safer""ù (cesium chloride-free) Hepatitis B vaccine, which Bharat Biotech claims to be the first in the world. Suchitra is the JMD of the company.Over the years, it launched a string of vaccines, therapeutics and bio-therapeutics. Just before launching Rotavac, Bharat Biotech unveiled the world's first typhoid conjugate vaccine, with a claimed efficacy of 87%. The company has a dozen other vaccines that claim to prevent diseases such as haemophilus influenzae, polio, swine flu, rabies, Japanese encephalitis and hepatitis B. It is working on a string of vaccines against chikungunya and Zika infections, human papillomavirus and malaria. Research is also on to develop an ""intranasal vaccination process""ù, which may open up a new mode of vaccine delivery.Referring to this bouquet of vaccines, a former deputy director of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation says: ""Vaccine and drug manufacturers see a lot of failures when they try to develop new products. This hurtles them to severe losses as well. But in the case of BB, the number of failures are far fewer than their peers. They've managed to come out with a successful vaccine every three-four years.""ùIn 2019, the company reported a profit of `112 crore on a turnover of Rs 763 crore. According to a private equity player specialising in unlisted pharma companies, Bharat Biotech posted a net sales in excess of Rs 1,100 crore last financial year; the profit range was estimated at Rs 250-320 crore.Bharat Biotech's product concentration is high with nearly 85% of its revenues coming from Rotavac, TCV and the oral polio vaccine. ""90% of the company's revenues come from vaccines,""ù says a person close to the company. ""Rotavac, TCV, antirabies vaccine and oral polio vaccine are the biggest revenue-earners. Apart from selling vaccines to central and state governments, the company has a robust play in the private market, too. The paediatrics/doctor network alone brings in Rs 100-120 crore worth of sales.""ùWhile Ella gushes about affordable vaccines, his company has veered away from the low-margin oral polio vaccine business. Instead, Bharat Biotech is lobbying hard to sell its rotavirus and typhoid vaccines, which have better margins.""Ella is a man of science, but his business acumen is very good,""ù says a Hyderabad-based pharma business consultant. In February 2019, BB acquired Chiron Behring Vaccines, a small unit of GSK that specialises in rabies vaccine. The manufacturing facility was refurbished and the vaccine was rebranded and re-launched as Chirorab (earlier Rabipur). Chiron Behring is believed to have logged revenues in the range of `80""ì120 crore last financial year.""The Chiron acquisition is a wellplanned one. There's a shortage of rabies vaccine world over, much like the antidotes for a snake bite,""ù the pharma business consultant adds. Bharat Biotech's Japanese encephalitis vaccine, Jenvac, is another example of a product that serves a small section of the population but rings in sizable profits. This type of encephalitis is mostly seen in North and East India, and countries like China, Thailand, Cambodia, Nepal and Malaysia. Jenvac brings in Rs 30""ì50 crore.The biotechnology company is a tightly held family business and has only a handful of investors. Nearly 75% of the equity rests with the Ellas. According to data from Tracxn, the company has a dozen institutional funders and three angel investors. Among the funders are three ""investment""ù grants - from the Department of Biotechnology, Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. ICICI Venture, Subhkam Ventures and IFC are the only private equity investors in the company. Bharat Biotech has received just over $13.73 million worth of funding so far.The investors seem to be happy with BB's growth and Ella's leadership. ""The company is growing at 30""ì35% CAGR,""ù says Rakesh Kathotia, founder-chairman of Subhkam Ventures and an investor in Bharat Biotech. ""Ella understands diseases and vaccines. Science forms the basis of his business. We'll continue our journey with him.""ù Kathotia, an avid investor, invested in Bharat Biotech some 15 years ago, convinced by Ella's vision to manufacture affordable vaccines.Manu Punnoose, MD of Subhkam, says: ""We're very happy as Bharat Biotech has managed to roll out some blockbuster vaccines over the past few years. Beyond that, Ella is a good human being. He never brags about his achievements, which are many.""ùThough not many know it, the Ellas have branched out to other businesses as well. Ella Foods deals with ""cryogenically ground cold pasteurised spices.""ù BIOVET works around veterinary drugs and vaccines. This vertical has already launched vaccines to prevent foot-and-mouth disease, bluetongue disease and haemorrhagic septicaemia among livestock. But the family's core business is making vaccines for humans. And, going by what paediatricians say, it should.""The rotavirus and typhoid vaccines have helped in reducing the incidence of two deadly diseases that affect children,""ù says Dr Harish Kumar Pemde, a member of Indian Academy of Pediatrics. ""BB's rotavirus and typhoid vaccines are landmark products. The fact that WHO has prequalified these vaccines speaks for their quality.""ùJust like the Covid vaccine, Bharat Biotech faced serious challenges while developing the rotavirus vaccine, too. The clinical trials had to be conducted on newborn babies. The company took nearly 10 years to finish the trials and get the necessary approvals.The hard work has not gone unnoticed. ""BB's rotavirus vaccine was their best till date. It has very high efficacy rates,""ù says Dr Ashish Bavdekar, associate professor & consultant in paediatric research at KEM Hospital, Pune. ""But it was a long-drawn process covering thousands of newborn babies.""ù Bavdekar participated in the clinical trials as an investigator. The road to a Covid vaccine wasn't easy either. But the scientist with a business acumen has brought it this far. There are many who are betting on him to go much further. It is a journey Ella will have to helm as carefully as the driver who transported the virus strain from Pune to Hyderabad.","chikungunya, influenza, malaria, typhoid, japanese encephalitis",,,,,,,,

But it should also be remembered as the first respiratory disease pandemic in which non-pharmaceutical interventions were widely used to eliminate transmission, including in large countries such as China. As the covid-19 pandemic continues to intensify across much of the globe, many countries are increasing their use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as ""lockdowns""ù to mitigate its harmful effects. Here we describe the potential benefits of using an elimination strategy to minimise the negative health and economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic. Pursuing this strategy will become more feasible when effective vaccines are widely available.  Strategic choices for pandemic responses The typical approach of high income nations (such as those in North America and Europe) has been a ""suppression strategy,""ù sometimes after initial use of a ""mitigation strategy""ù (fig 1). The goal of suppression is to flatten the epidemic curve further than with mitigation, but still without expecting to end community transmission.1 These approaches are largely consistent with plans designed to mitigate or suppress pandemic influenza. Fig 1 Strategic choices for responding to covid-19 and other pandemics. These choices can be divided according to goal: no community transmission (exclusion and elimination), controlled transmission (suppression and mitigation), or uncontrolled transmission. Some jurisdictions pursuing elimination describe this goal as containment. Although the framework divides approaches into five strategies, they exist on a continuum in and between categories. Countries may also change their strategic direction based on experience with controlling the pandemic. By contrast, China's success in containing the pandemic has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be eliminated even after widespread community transmission.2 Several other Asian jurisdictions also achieved some success in containing the pandemic at an early stage, notably Taiwan,3 Hong Kong,4 and South Korea.5 Confronted with the rapidly spreading covid-19 pandemic in January 2020, New Zealand initially rolled out its existing national influenza pandemic plan as the basis for its response. Australia did likewise. Fortunately, both countries had a brief period to refine their approaches before the first reported covid-19 case arrived on 25 January in Australia and 26 February in New Zealand. This timing gave them an opportunity to learn from the effects of the pandemic on countries in the northern hemisphere and consider the different response strategies (fig 1). The New Zealand government chose an explicit elimination approach.67 Australia also has elimination of community transmission as the stated goal, but has generally described its strategy as ""aggressive suppression.""ù8 A related strategy that also aims to achieve zero community transmission is the exclusion approach that has been successfully used by some Pacific Island countries and territories (fig 1). The goal of elimination is a major departure from pandemic influenza mitigation. With a mitigation goal, the response is typically to increase stringency as the pandemic progresses and for more disruptive interventions, such as school closures, to be held in reserve to flatten the peak. By contrast, the goal of elimination rapidly escalates the stringency of control measures to extinguish chains of transmission. Choosing a strategy is not necessarily a fixed path, and countries might change their approach. Sweden, for example, initially seemed to pursue a version of mitigation with the intent of achieving herd immunity and then seemed to switch to a suppression strategy.9  Defining disease elimination Disease elimination has been used to control a wide range of human and animal infectious diseases, although an effective vaccine is generally required for the final phase.10 Eradication refers to the global reduction to zero (for example, smallpox and the animal disease rinderpest). There is no internationally agreed definition of covid-19 elimination. But there are three main elements that we would expect to see in such a definition (box 1).1112 Countries pursuing elimination aim for zero transmission in the community but accept that outbreaks from border control failures might occur, resulting in a temporary loss of elimination status until community transmission is again stopped. Box 1 Provisional definition of covid-19 elimination A definition for elimination of covid-19 could include the following three components (modified from11): Absence of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 virus infections from community transmission- within a defined jurisdiction or region, for a specified period (such as 28 days since the last known case in the community was placed into isolation)  Presence of a high performing surveillance system-with appropriate targeting and geographic and demographic coverage, operating continuously, with sufficient volumes of testing to provide reasonable certainty of detecting outbreaks in a set period (for example, testing a specified minimum number of people per 1000 population per day or a specified minimum number of tests per day)  Acceptance of suitable exemptions-such as cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among incoming travellers detected at the border and held in supervised isolation or quarantine facilities until safe to release into the community and potentially cases of community transmission that are epidemiologically and genomically linked to staff or a traveller in an isolation or quarantine facility. RETURN TO TEXT  Achieving and sustaining disease elimination New Zealand and Australian experiences of the covid-19 pandemic offer lessons for achieving and sustaining elimination (see supplementary file online for additional details). Firstly, elimination is more likely to be achieved quickly with informed scientific input, strong political commitment, and decisive action. To achieve elimination, New Zealand probably had no feasible alternative to a national lockdown (which began on 26 March 2020). The country's public health infrastructure was at a low point after decades of neglect.13 Time was needed to expand essential activities such as testing and contact tracing. A lockdown was probably also required to ensure that the population would swiftly understand and adhere to the physical distancing behaviours needed to limit spread of the virus.6714 Better preparedness, as seen in countries that experienced the SARS pandemic in 2003, reduced the need for stringent lockdowns, as exemplified by Taiwan.1516 Secondly, investment in three broad categories of public health infrastructure is needed to achieve elimination or quickly regain it in the event of an outbreak: border management with closely supervised quarantine of all arrivals from places that have not eliminated the virus; case based control measures, notably testing, case isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine; and population based interventions such as physical distancing and mask use. In addition, disease surveillance, coordination, and communication activities are critical to delivering an effective response.71417 Thirdly, outbreaks arising from border control failures might occur after elimination has been achieved and these require swift and decisive action. New Zealand experienced such an outbreak after three months without a case in the community (see supplementary file online). This outbreak was brought under control and elimination status regained after extensive testing, contact tracing, physical distancing, and mandated use of masks. Improved case based controls enabled these interventions to be geographically targeted with a shorter and less intense lockdown. The state of Victoria in Australia experienced a major resurgence peaking at over 700 cases a day yet managed to eliminate community transmission in three months using lockdowns and a detailed plan (""roadmap""ù) underpinned by modelling.8 Finally, given the inevitable loss of employment and other social disruption when stringent lockdowns are used, a range of health, social, and economic support measures are likely to be required.714 The New Zealand government's response has included multiple economic actions and income support measures to protect the most disadvantaged people. Australia was likewise rapid to implement economic support nationally to employers who kept workers on the payroll while unable to work. It also dramatically increased unemployment benefits for those becoming unemployed, and states and territories such as Victoria also initiated support packages.  Benefits, costs, and areas of uncertainty with disease elimination Achieving elimination offers major advantages, but also some disadvantages, compared with a suppression strategy that allows continued virus circulation. The balance of benefits and costs is uncertain, however, and may not be clear until after the pandemic has been fully controlled (see supplementary file). Obvious benefits of rapid elimination are greatly reduced case numbers, a lower risk of health sector overload, and fewer overall deaths from covid-19. There is also an opportunity to avoid serious health inequalities, such as the catastrophic effect of previous pandemics on MƒÅori, the Indigenous people of New Zealand.18 Similar concerns apply to the health of Indigenous Australians.19 Given the growing evidence for long term effects from SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are also benefits from reducing the numbers of even mild infections.20 One of the perceived barriers to applying a vigorous response, such as elimination, to the covid-19 pandemic is the belief that this might sacrifice the economy and ultimately result in more hardship and negative health effects. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the opposite is true. Countries following an elimination strategy (notably China, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand) have had markedly lower covid-19 mortality than those in Europe and North America pursuing mitigation and suppression. Similarly, the effect on gross domestic product (GDP), based on International Monetary Fund projections for all of 2020, was more favourable for countries with elimination goals than for those with suppression goals (see supplementary file). However strategic choices are assessed, the benefits and costs need to be considered using realistic alternative scenarios or counterfactuals. International tourism, for example, is substantially reduced regardless of individual countries having border control restrictions. Iceland reopened to tourism but the demand remained low, imported cases of covid-19 increased, and the net effect was a larger decline in GDP than was seen in New Zealand.21 Given the huge costs of the pandemic response, gaining as many co-benefits as possible is important (see supplementary file). One such benefit is improved public health infrastructure that can support a more rapid and effective response to future pandemics, as seen in Taiwan.15 The covid-19 pandemic response has also emphasised the importance of integrating scientific advice into decision making that could improve capacity to respond to a range of major existential threats including climate change.  Future use of the elimination strategy Several institutional, technical, and scientific actions could enable more widespread adoption of elimination approaches and better chances of success for jurisdictions already committed to an elimination goal (box 2). The World Health Organization would be the ideal agency to facilitate some of these institutional measures, supported by other agencies. Technological advances in such areas as rapid point-of-care antigen testing could make elimination more feasible.23 Box 2 Actions to support use of an elimination strategy for covid-19 and future pandemic diseases Institutional actions, including guidelines Develop a standard definition for covid-19 elimination (box 1)  Revise WHO reporting processes and standards to accurately represent the covid-19 elimination status of countries, notably to distinguish imported cases (who acquired their infections outside that country and are in isolation/quarantine facilities) from those in the community and to report if they have achieved elimination (box 1) and the date this was reached  Develop a process for review of country progress towards elimination to facilitate quarantine-free movement between countries meeting agreed standards (analogous to the verification approach applied to elimination of diseases such as polio, measles, and rubella)  Identify conditions and infrastructure needs to support an elimination approach at national and subnational levels (for example, by state and territory in Australia)  Develop evidence informed guidelines for approaches that countries can use to engage populations in disease elimination programmes, including partnerships with at-risk groups in pandemic strategy decision making; ensuring transparency and accountability; effective public communication  Establish a network of agencies to share scientific knowledge about the elimination approach  Revise pandemic plans to reflect the role of elimination as a potential method for responding to future severe pandemic disease threats, including pandemic influenza. These plans could include a typology of strategic response options (fig 1) and guidelines to help select an optimal approach (including exclusion strategies22). Technical and scientific actions Improve SARS-CoV-2 testing, notably rapid, low cost, point-of-care antigen testing  Develop tools to support rapid contact tracing, notably digital and analytical tools that enhance manual contact tracing  Evaluate and document case studies and methods used to achieve elimination of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission (eg, mandated mass masking)  Analyse and evaluate optimal use of the elimination approach (relative to control options such as mitigation and suppression), notably its role in complementing future vaccination scenarios  Conduct an integrated epidemiological and economic analysis of future pandemic management choices (fig 1) to guide decision making that considers wider medium and longer term health, equity, and economic effects. RETURN TO TEXT Experience with covid-19 elimination indicates that this goal is achievable in a wide range of settings. Elimination seems to be the dominant strategy in multiple Asian jurisdictions, including China, Hong Kong (China), Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Mongolia. Future collaborative research could consider all these jurisdictions to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the effects of the elimination approach. Experience in Asia and in some states in Australia is that long complex borders can be managed to largely prevent importation of covid-19 from adjacent jurisdictions. Conditions favouring successful elimination include informed input from scientists, political commitment to take decisive action, sufficient public health infrastructure to deliver the necessary interventions, public engagement and trust in the measures being taken, and a social safety net to support vulnerable populations. The introduction of effective covid-19 vaccines is also likely to facilitate elimination. Countries and jurisdictions combating the pandemic will need to consider two main choices. They could take a control approach (suppression) using a range of vaccination strategies to protect the most vulnerable people (as with seasonal influenza) and accepting that SARS-CoV-2 virus infection might become endemic in their population. Or they could follow an elimination strategy using vaccination systematically to reduce transmission to zero in the population and to help contain outbreaks if they occur (as most countries now approach measles). Global eradication could eventually be considered if national and regional elimination proves feasible and if it is justifiable based on economic analysis, as was the case with smallpox. Some of the most important lessons from the covid-19 response are about the management of future pandemics. Elimination is probably the preferred strategy for responding to new emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential and anything more than moderate severity, particularly while key parameters are being estimated. Some biological and ecological factors also need to be considered before deciding that a novel disease can be eliminated, notably the role of animal reservoirs.10 Non-pharmaceutical interventions are usually the only early interventions available. The experience of Asia-Pacific countries such as China, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand shows the benefits of applying these measures rapidly and intensively with the goal of elimination. The New Zealand response also eliminated seasonal influenza in the winter of 2020, showing that it is also a potential option (cost effectiveness aside) for preventing future influenza pandemics.24  Conclusions about use of the elimination strategy Experience indicates that elimination of covid-19 has been successful in several jurisdictions, albeit with occasional outbreaks from border control failures that need to be managed rapidly and effectively. Elimination is associated with major public health and equity benefits, and it probably reduced overall economic contraction relative to the suppression strategy. It also has the potential to support covid-19 containment while long term interventions, notably vaccination, are being developed, assessed, and implemented. We need tools and guidelines to support decision making around effective use of elimination approaches for responding to covid-19 and future pandemics (box 2). Research and development are needed to provide a greater evidence base on the circumstances where the elimination strategy is likely to be the optimal approach. Key messages A goal of eliminating community transmission of the pandemic virus causing covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is achievable and sustainable for some jurisdictions using non-pharmaceutical interventions and will be facilitated by the introduction of effective vaccines  Elimination of community transmission offers public health, equity, and potentially economic advantages compared with a control strategy using mitigation or suppression  Conditions favouring successful elimination include informed input from scientists, political commitment, sufficient public health infrastructure, public engagement and trust, and a safety net to support vulnerable populations  Elimination might be the preferred strategy for responding to new emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential and moderate to high severity, particularly while key parameters are being estimated  Acknowledgments We thank Amanda Kvalsvig, John Potter, the reviewers, and The BMJ's editorial staff for helpful comments on the manuscript.

More than 20 million chickens have been destroyed in South Korea and Japan since November. The highly pathogenic H5N8 virus last week reached India, the world's No. 6 producer, and has already been reported in 10 states.  While bird flu is common in Asia at this time of year due to migratory bird flight patterns, new strains of the virus have evolved to become more lethal in wild birds, making countries on flight pathways particularly vulnerable, say experts.  ""This is one of the worst outbreaks ever in India,"" said Mohinder Oberoi, an Indian animal health expert and former advisor to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  ""There's a lot of disease in crows and ducks. People are scared of the disease in crows. They know they fly far and think they'll infect their poultry or even people.""  The Asian outbreak comes as Europe suffers its worst bird flu outbreak in years, and follows on the heels of COVID-19, which hurt poultry sales early on in some places amid false disease concerns but is now driving up demand due to more home cooking. Chicken prices in India fell almost a third last week as wary consumers, increasingly nervous about disease since the pandemic, steered clear of the meat.  Bird flu cannot infect people through poultry consumption, and the H5N8 virus is not known to have ever infected humans, but consumers are still fearful, said Uddhav Ahire, chairman of Anand Agro Group, a poultry company based in the western city of Nashik.  Live chicken prices are already as low as 58 Indian rupees ($0.79) a kilogram, below the cost of production, he said.  In South Korea and Japan, no market impact has been seen yet, officials said, with stronger demand for chicken meat for home cooked meals during lockdowns having a greater effect on prices.  Virus evolution  The rapid and wide geographic spread of the latest outbreaks make this one of the worst waves in Asia since the early 2000s.  In Japan, where outbreaks have been reported from Chiba near Tokyo to more than 1,000 kilometers away in Miyazaki on Kyushu island in just two months, fresh cases are still occurring.  ""We can't say risk of the further spread of bird flu has diminished as the migration season for wild birds will continue till March, or even April in some cases,"" said an animal health official in the agriculture ministry.  The H5N8 viruses detected in Japan and Korea are very similar to those that spread through Europe in 2019, which in turn evolved from viruses that were prevalent in 2014, said Filip Claes, head of the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases.  A different variant circulating in Europe since late 2020 is also causing significant damage.  The new strains are causing more harm now that they are more lethal in wild birds, said Holly Shelton, influenza expert at Britain's Pirbright Institute.  ""It's quite clear that this virus has established itself in the wild bird population and so now there's a greater propensity for it to spill over back into poultry farms,"" she said.  A compulsory flu vaccination for poultry in China has protected the region's top producer, even though the virus has killed wild swans there.  Indonesia, Asia's No. 2 producer, is only a temporary transit point for wild birds, reducing its risk of infection, said Fadjar Sumping Tjatur Rassa, director of animal health at the Agriculture Ministry.  Still, the country has banned live bird imports from countries with H5N8 and set up a surveillance system for early detection of the virus, he said.  With no major bird flight pathways over Southeast Asia, countries like Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have so far been spared H5N8 outbreaks but face risks from the movement of people and goods.

""There's a lot of disease in crows and ducks. People are scared of the disease in crows. They know they fly far and think they'll infect their poultry or even people.""  Advertisement  Advertisement  The Asian outbreak comes as Europe suffers its worst bird flu outbreak in years, and follows on the heels of COVID-19, which hurt poultry sales early on in some places amid false disease concerns but is now driving up demand due to more home cooking.  Chicken prices in India fell almost a third last week as wary consumers, increasingly nervous about disease since the pandemic, steered clear of the meat.  Bird flu cannot infect people through poultry consumption, and the H5N8 virus is not known to have ever infected humans, but consumers are still fearful, said Uddhav Ahire, chairman of Anand Agro Group, a poultry company based in the western city of Nashik.  Live chicken prices are already as low as 58 Indian rupees (US$0.79) a kilogram, below the cost of production, he said.  Advertisement  In South Korea and Japan, no market impact has been seen yet, officials said, with stronger demand for chicken meat for home cooked meals during lockdowns having a greater effect on prices.  VIRUS EVOLUTION  The rapid and wide geographic spread of the latest outbreaks make this one of the worst waves in Asia since the early 2000s.  In Japan, where outbreaks have been reported from Chiba near Tokyo to more than 1,000km away in Miyazaki on Kyushu island in just two months, fresh cases are still occurring.  ""We can't say risk of the further spread of bird flu has diminished as the migration season for wild birds will continue till March, or even April in some cases,"" said an animal health official in the agriculture ministry.  The H5N8 viruses detected in Japan and Korea are very similar to those that spread through Europe in 2019, which in turn evolved from viruses that were prevalent in 2014, said Filip Claes, head of the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD).  A different variant circulating in Europe since late 2020 is also causing significant damage.  The new strains are causing more harm now they are more lethal in wild birds, said Holly Shelton, influenza expert at Britain's Pirbright Institute.  ""It's quite clear that this virus has established itself in the wild bird population and so now there's a greater propensity for it to spill over back into poultry farms,"" she said.  A compulsory flu vaccination for poultry in China has protected the region's top producer, even though the virus has killed wild swans there.  Indonesia, Asia's No 2 producer, is only a temporary transit point for wild birds, reducing its risk of infection, said Fadjar Sumping Tjatur Rassa, director of animal health at the Agriculture Ministry.  Still, the country has banned live bird imports from countries with H5N8 and set up a surveillance system for early detection of the virus, he said.  With no major bird flight pathways over Southeast Asia, countries like Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have so far been spared H5N8 outbreaks, but face risks from the movement of people and goods.  ""It will keep spreading until another virus comes along to replace it,"" said Shelton.  ",influenza,,,,,,,,

TOP STORY: Boogerd Thinks Groenewgen Has Been Punished Enough  Last month it was announced that Dylan Groenewegen had been suspended for nine months for causing Fabio Jakobsen's crash in the Tour of Poland. Former rider Michael Boogerd is convinced that the consequences of the fall had been taken into account. ""It shouldn't have been for me, because I think that Groenewegen has been punished enough anyway,""ù said Boogerd on Zesdaagse TV, where he was a guest with Lucinda Brand and Pieter Weening. ""I think he is still not comfortable on the bike. A lot has happened to him and then he has to be out until the beginning of May.""ù  Safety in cycling in general was also discussed. Weening has seen many changes in recent years. ""Fifteen years ago, a signal was sometimes given when a car was half on the road. Nowadays they all think: ""òIf there are ten men less'. There is a lot of stress. The road network is also just different, many more obstacles, roundabouts, central reservation. It's busier along the way. It is becoming increasingly unsafe.""ù  To make the sport safer, the course can be looked at, said Boogerd. ""But it is still possible that there will be no crashes. What Pieter says, it always depends on the riders. I mean, you can race on a straight road twenty meters wide ""¶ but if they push, throw or pull each other, you just go. Then it's the end of the story. I think the biggest change lies with the riders themselves.""ù  ""We have now also seen it in the Vuelta with Sam Bennett, who gives headbutts in a full sprint. Then you see the turmoil that actually arises, with Patrick Lefevere who is angry again. Then we think, do we never learn? One of his best riders, Jakobsen, has hit the asphalt and is out for a long time. And now a rider of his does something and it is all downplayed again,""ù said Boogerd.  Brand believes that riders themselves also have a responsibility to protect each other. ""In the women's peloton, however, you also see that, for example, the signaling or the fences often leave something to be desired and then you also have to look at the athlete. I think it is very good that we as riders make our voice heard. But we also have to look at ourselves and come up with solutions, and not just say very angry that it is not right.""ù  Zesdaagse TV:      Jakobsen at the Deceuninck ""ì Quick-Step Training Camp  Fabio Jakobsen is in Spain at the Deceuninck ""ì Quick-Step training camp, reported Het Nieuwsblad. The rehabilitating Dutch sprinter heads to Altea for the first team camp for the 2021 season.  Team doctor Yvan Vanmol already looked ahead to the training camp at the end of November. ""His holiday has done him (Jakobsen) mentally good to reset his head. On the camp, Fabio will immediately know how he feels about cycling in a group. And if necessary we will guide him in this.""ù  All the Deceuninck ""ì Quick-Step riders are gathered in Altea, a Spanish coastal town on the Costa Blanca. Mark Cavendish, the latest addition to the team, will also be present. Some of the riders had already been in Spain on their own initiative, the other riders traveled to the Costa Blanca last weekend or Monday.  The Belgian team had to move to a different location this year. ""We usually stay at Hotel Suitopia in Calpe, but that hotel will only reopen its doors in February due to the corona virus,""ù sports director Wilfried Peeters.  In Altea, the team hopes to prepare as well as possible for the new season, but the riders will not just sit on the bike. For example, Deceuninck ""ì Quick-Step is taking the opportunity to try on the new kits for 2021 and the team will provide psychological assistance after a particularly strange and hectic 2020.  This time it is up to the riders to determine the duration of their training period. Some riders will return home at the end of the week, according to Het Nieuwsblad, while others will stay in Spain until the festive season. The Belgian team has isolated itself in its own bubble.  Fabio Jakobsen training again:      No Covid Vaccine for Sunweb (DSM) Yet  UAE Team Emirates manager Mauro Gianetti said on Monday that he wants to have his riders and staff members vaccinated against Covid-19 in January. Team Sunweb (DSM) will not go that fast. ""We follow and support the guidelines of the national governments.""ù  Gianetti was one of 30,000 subjects for Phase 3 testing of the Chinese SinoPharm vaccine in the United Arab Emirates. He was given two doses and had no side effects. Next month he wants to vaccinate the riders and staff members of his UAE Team Emirates during the team training camp in Abu Dhabi. Although no one will have to if they don't want, he added.  The Belgian and Dutch WorldTour teams (DSM will have a German license) do not seem to be participating in the rush to get a corona vaccine for the time being. ""We are not bypassing the government and will not select vaccines as we see fit,""ù a Team Sunweb spokesperson told Dutch website WielerFlits. ""This is about public health and that is how we deal with it. We follow and support the guidelines of the national governments.""ù  The same reaction was noted by Het Laatste Nieuws by John Lelangue of Lotto Soudal. ""I am CEO of a Belgian employer. Until the Belgian government says that professional athletes may be vaccinated, we will follow the normal corona protocol. Cycling is just a sport.""ù Deceuninck ""ì Quick-Step also has no plans, says manager Patrick Lefevere.  Apparently they are still waiting at Jumbo-Visma. ""If that opportunity arises, we will use it on a voluntary basis,""ù spokesperson Ard Bierens said.  Masks for a bit longer yet:      Wout van Aert Has No Cerv√©lo Cross Bike  Jumbo-Visma will be changing from Bianchi bikes to Cerv√©lo on January the 1st. For Wout van Aert, the new collaboration falls in the middle of the cross season, but we will not see him on a Cerv√©lo in a cross race as the brand does not have a cross bike according to bicycle magazine Grinta. Jef Van den Bosch, Van Aert's manager, confirmed to Het Nieuwsblad. ""Cerv√©lo is working on the development of a cross bike, but it is not here yet. Moreover, it is not really beneficial to change bikes during the season.""ù  It is still uncertain which bike the three-time world champion will be riding if he starts the X¬≤O round in Baal on January 1st. He will probably ride his Bianchi Zolder Pro cross bike to the end of the season without all brand names and the blue-green Bianchi colour.  No Cerv√©lo cross bike for Wout yet:      Spring Schedule for Mark Cavendish  Mark Cavendish arrived in Spain on Monday for his first training camp with Deceuninck ""ì Quick-Step. But his spring program has also largely been mapped out. ""Competitions in which he can gain confidence,""ù says Wilfried Peeters. ""Without pressure.""ù  At Deceuninck ""ì Quick-Step they want to build with Cavendish on his performances in Gent-Wevelgem and the Scheldeprijs, two races in which he opted for the attack and was in the lead for half a day in the wind. That is precisely why October 2020 was ""his best month in a long time,""ù he stated.  ""Cavendish must be given time.""ù sports director Wilfried Peeters told Het Laatste Nieuws. ""We are going to bring him in a calm manner. We also have to find out where his condition is and what he can do, because at the moment we do not know what he is worth.""ù  The road has already been mapped out: In February he can ride his first stage race, followed by a number of one-day races such as Nokere and Handzame. ""Without the pressure to win. In a manner of speaking, he can race up to five kilometres before the finish, we will do the rest,""ù said Peeters. ""The intention is to first give him back his confidence, then we can talk about performance.""ù  Hoping to return to past victories:      Emanuel Buchmann: ""Podium in a Grand Tour is Possible""ù  After his fourth place in 2019, Emanuel Buchmann wanted to take a shot at the podium in the Tour de France last season. But due to a crash in the Dauphin√©, he didn't reach his top form. Now he has his sights on the new cycling year.  Buchmann had a successful start to the season with a win in the Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana and ninth place in Pollen√ßa-Andratx. ""That victory in Mallorca was great. I don't win that often, so that was special ""ì even if it was a fairly small race,""ù the German rider told radsport-news.com. But then he had to leave the UAE Tour prematurely after a crash and the season came to a halt due to the corona virus.  After the lockdown, he wanted to work towards the Tour de France via the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©. In the first days of the five-day stage race he came third and fourth, but on the fourth day he crashed heavily on a descent and had to abandon. With some doubts he started in the Tour, where he was initially able to compete with the best, but after a week it turned out that his form was not good enough for a top result.  ""The weeks after the fall in the Dauphin√© and in the Tour were the bitterest in my career,""ù said the German. ""If you put so much time and energy into one goal, it is cruel when a crash occurs that I could not help myself.""ù In the end he completed the Tour working for his BORA-hansgrohe team, but he cancelled his planned participation in the Vuelta a Espa√±a, in consultation with the team.  Buchmann hopes to be able to deal with last season's bad luck in 2021. Whether his focus is back on the Tour or another Grand Tour is still uncertain. ""Despite everything we saw in the Dauphin√© where I am and that if everything goes perfectly, the podium in a Grand Tour is possible. So we will make another attempt in 2021. Whether it will be the Tour is not yet clear. The course is certainly not ideal for me.""ù  Buchmann winning in Mallorca:      Mikel Landa is Aiming for Two Grand Tours in 2021  Mikel Landa has set his sights on the Tour de France for next season. Last year, the Spaniard finished fourth in the French race, equaling his best performance three years ago. He also wants to return to the Giro d'Italia or the Vuelta a Espa√±a.  Landa left Movistar for Bahrain-McLaren last winter. In his debut year with the team, the Spaniard finished on the podium of the Ruta del Sol and the Vuelta a Burgos and finished in fourth place in the Tour de France, just under 6 minutes behind overall winner Tadej Pogaƒçar. ""The Tour is the big goal of the year, that is clear. But in addition Mikel wants to ride another Grans Tour. Due to the known circumstances, that year did not fit, but with a normal calendar he wants to do two Grand Tours,""ù his team told Deia.  Since the start of his professional career in 2011, Landa often rode two Grand Tours in a year. In 2014 and 2015, he combined the Giro d'Italia with the Vuelta a Espa√±a, finishing third in the Giro in 2015 ""ì his best finish in a Grand Tour to date. In 2016, 2017 and 2019 he started in both the Giro and the Tour. He has won a stage in a Grand Tour four times; in 2015 in the Giro stages to Madonna di Campiglio and Aprica, later that year he won the mountain stage to Cortals d'Encamp in the Vuelta and in 2017 he triumphed in the Giro stage to Piancavallo.  It is still uncertain which of the other Grand Tours Landa will ride as well as the Tour de France. He will not make that decision until the routes of the Giro and the Vuelta are known; He will race the Tour that suits him best. The Spaniard will leave for the Canary Islands on today, Thursday, for a training camp in the run-up to the new season. Which he should start with the Ruta de Sol, and then hone his form in the Tour of the Basque Country. ""That's one of Mikel's goals. He wants to be good at his home race.  Landa looking forward to 2021:      Giacomo Nizzolo has Milan-Sanremo in His Sights  For Giacomo Nizzolo, a successful season came to an abrupt end due to a muscle tear in his lower leg. As a result, the European champion had to leave the Tour early. For 2021, he has already set his sights on Milan-Sanremo. He also wants to try Paris-Roubaix.  Last month it was announced that Nizzolo will remain loyal to the Qhubeka ASSOS team in 2021. ""I stayed with this team because I wanted a project that revolves around me. It's important to keep working with the people I already know. I already felt familiar with the project. I wanted to be a part of it and take it to the next level,""ù he told TuttoBICI.  The Italian sprinter can look back on a strong season, in which he achieved stage victories in the Tour Down Under and Paris-Nice, finished fifth in Milan-Sanremo and then won both the Italian and the European championships. ""It was a very important season. I was competitive from the start, after finally having a winter without physical problems. It was also a confirmation to myself.""ù  ""It was a shame about the Tour de France. In the third stage I finished third, but I felt that I had more legs. Still, I couldn't find the right gap in the sprint, those are things that can happen. And then came the muscle tear, which made me give up. The recovery time was long and as I would not be competitive in the last races of the season, I preferred to quit altogether out of respect for the two titles I won.""ù  ""I want to be good from the start of the season with Milan-San Remo in my sights and the Belgian classics, which are suitable for sprinters. I would like to test myself in Paris-Roubaix or the other cobbled classics, but I think the Tour of Flanders is too tough. When it comes to the big laps, I would love to wear the European jersey in the Giro d'Italia, but I know the Tour de France is important to the team. I could also ride them both.""ù  Giacomo Nizzolo:      2021 World Cyclocross Championships in Ostend Without Fans  The cyclocross World championship can take place in Ostend in 2021. All parties involved agree, the organisers report in a press release. The World Championships will take place without an audience because of the corona crisis.  ""All parties involved made an extra effort. For example, the top of the international World of cyclocross can descend on Ostend at the end of January. The World Championships will be followed live from home by many enthusiasts worldwide,""ù said the organisation, which is supported by the UCI, Belgian Cycling, the Flemish government and the municipality of Ostend.  The Flemish sports minister Ben Weyts is extremely satisfied with the state of affairs. ""All parties have made efforts to make the World Cup possible in these difficult times,""ù says Weyts. ""The World Championships are the high mass of the season for our Flemish top riders, but also for TV-watching Flanders. Top events like this give us Flemish collective moments of joy.""ù  Rik Debeaussaert of the organisation is happy that the decision has been made. ""We have always believed in it and had examined all the different scenarios. We are therefore very proud that all the hard work in recent weeks, months and years has finally led to a decision. Now we only look ahead and count down the days to the spectacle,""ù said Debeaussaert.  A lot of work is also being done on the course. On the night of 7 to 8 December, the bridge was installed that connects the beach with the rest of the course on the Wellington Racecourse. The cyclocross World Championships are scheduled for January 30 and 31, 2021. Last winter Mathieu van der Poel and Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado were crowned World champions.

In a time that has been particularly challenging for South Australians, Premier Steven Marshall said that he is thrilled that South Australia can deliver an event program to start the 2021 cycling season.  ""South Australia has a strong track record in delivering world class events, which create jobs and deliver substantial economic benefit to the state. To be able to pivot, innovate, and deliver a high calibre event, in a new COVID-normal environment, for all Australians to enjoy is particularly exciting,""ù said Premier Marshall.  For the first time the Challenge Tour will go digital in collaboration with FulGaz, with further details being announced soon, along with an exciting festival program and calendar of events.  Santos Managing Director and CEO, Kevin Gallagher said, ""Santos is pleased to continue to support and partner on initiatives that make a positive contribution to the South Australian community and we look forward to enjoying a great summer of cycling.""ù  The Inclusion of other cycling disciplines of Cyclo-Cross, BMX, Track, Paracycling and Mountain Biking is another considered element of the festival, which in collaboration with newly formed national body, Aus Cycling, will celebrate the inclusion of all cycling disciplines under one new national banner.  Executive Director of Events South Australia, Hitaf Rasheed said the Santos Festival of Cycling has been designed to bring visitors from across Australia and South Australia to the City of Adelaide and regional communities during January.

Race Director Stuart O'Grady said ""It's fantastic that Richie and his family are back in Australia after an incredible year. For all the cycling fans out there and the public to be able to congratulate Richie in person for his historic podium in the TDF is just amazing. Being in Adelaide and supporting this event means a lot to the Santos Dour Down Under team behind the race and gives the young up and coming riders an amazing opportunity to ride alongside one of this country's greatest cyclists""ù.  We would like to thank his team for next year, ""INEOS Grenadiers""ù in allowing him to return to Australia.  Richie Porte said it will be nice to come back and see some good young Aussie talent. ""There is plenty to love about Adelaide in January and it will be nice to catch up with the Aussie cycling fans to say hi. I think it's good the South Australian government has got behind it too""ù.  Ticketing information is available at: www.tourdownunder.com.au/ticketing  Porte might just win again:      UCI Wants a Smaller Male Peloton for 2024 Olympics  The UCI are looking ahead to the 2024 Games in Paris. Gender equality must be in place by then and this will in particular will have consequences for the road races.  For the Olympic Games in Paris, there must be one hundred percent gender equality, for all sports and also for cycling. For Tokyo, this is already the case for mountain biking and BMX, but road and track cycling will also be changed before 2024. This has consequences for the road race for men and women.  A peloton of ninety riders is planned for both races in four years time. This is good news for all female cyclists, as there are only 67 places available in Tokyo. For the men it is a big cut, since the peloton will have 130 riders in 2021. For the women there will be an increase from 67 to 90, for the men there is a significant reduction from 130 to 90, a loss of 40 in the number of participants. ""We are proud of the fact that we have achieved this,""ù said UCI president David Lappartient in a press release. ""Gender equality is high on the agenda for the Paris Games.""ù  ""The UCI is committed to the policy that we want to see an equal representation of men and women everywhere. This is another important step, after introducing a minimum salary for female cycling professionals. This is a strong gesture to all athletes and all of society. I want to thank the International Olympic Committee for its support.""ù    Orange and A.S.O. extend their partnership for the Tour de France  Partners for over 21 years, Orange and A.S.O. will collaborate again for the next four editions of the Tour de France.  Each year, Orange and A.S.O. work together to devise and deploy innovative and responsible telecommunications technologies along the route of the race, making this event the third most watched sporting competition in the world.  The Tour visits various towns and villages in France, which makes it an excellent opportunity for Orange to develop digital and network technology across the country. The 2021 Tour de France will be no exception, as the race will cover 9 regions and 38 departments. From the race start in Brittany, to the Col du Tourmalet, passing through Mont Ventoux, and the legendary finish along the Champs-Elys√©es, this 108th edition promises even more entertainment, guaranteed by technology offered by Orange.  Since 1999, Orange has continued to implement the latest technological advances to support the Tour de France, in order to meet the needs of the organisers, the media, partners and the spectators. Whilst 2004 and 2012 stood out for the arrival of 3G and 4G to the race, 2021 will be known for even greater quality of service with the introduction of the 5G network. Over the years, Orange has made changes to meet needs relating to broadcasting, security and connectivity in technical areas.  Christian Prudhomme, director of the Tour de France, said: ""The Tour is an ongoing challenge, physical for the riders, but also technological for the entire organisation, notably for Orange. The quality of the telecoms network and the expertise of Orange's national and local teams are essential for each stage to be a success. So I'm very happy that Orange is by our side for the next four years of challenges and achievements.""ù  Fabienne Dulac, CEO of Orange France, said: ""Orange is proud to support the organisers, partners and spectators of the Tour de France for another four years. An exceptionally popular event, the Tour is a brilliant showcase of our natural and cultural heritage, but also our technological expertise. A good connection has become crucial for the race to run smoothly and reach as many people as possible. Orange is proud to be the supplier, thanks to the outstanding job done by its teams. The Tour also allows towns and unique locations to enjoy network upgrades, thanks to new permanent Orange Fibre, 4G and 5G installations. We are proud to strive to provide the best possible network across the country.""ù  More information about Tour de France on www.letour.fr  Orange and A.S.O. extend their partnership:      Kiryienka New Belarus National Coach  Vasil Kiryienka has found a new job. The 2015 time trial World champion will start working as head coach of the Belarusian road team. In addition, he will also coach of the national track team, reported Peloton.by.  In addition to his job as national coach, Kiryienka will also be sports director of the new continental team BelAZ. He will combine that work with former cyclist Yury Yurchanka. What the selection of BelAZ will look like will be announced soon, according to Belarus media.  Kiryienka decided at the end of January to retire as a professional cyclist at the age of 38 due to a heart condition. The time trial specialist raced for Sky/Ineos-Grenadiers for many years, and also rode for Tinkoff, Caisse d'Epargne and Movistar, and won stages in the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espa√±a during his career. The highlight of his career was the World Championship time trial in Richmond.  Vasil Kiryienka:      Tiralongo Leaves UAE Team Emirates  Paolo Tiralongo is leaving UAE Team Emirates after three years as a staff member. According to Spaziociclismo, the 43-year-old former rider leaves for development Velo Racing Team Palazzago, where he becomes sports director and trainer of talented riders.  Tiralongo stopped cycling at the end of 2017 and took a seat in the team car the following year. At UAE Emirates he teamed up with Fabio Aru, who he also coached. Last season Tiralongo was no longer a DS for the WorldTour team, but only a technical assistant. After Aru left to go to Qhubeka ASSOS, Tiralongo now left.  Tiralongo continues his career as a sports director with the amateurs of Velo Racing Team Palazzago from Bergamo. That team rode the Giro d'Italia U23 and the Piccolo Giro di Lombardia last season. Filippo Conca, now with Lotto Soudal in 2021, rode for two seasons for Palazzago in his youth. UAE Team Emirates also loses another sports director as Neil Stephens goes to Bahrain Victorious.  Paolo Tiralongo in Li√®ge:      HUNT to partner with Team Qhubeka ASSOS  Team Qhubeka ASSOS, Africa's only UCI-registered WorldTour cycling team, is delighted to announce our partnership with HUNT wheels from next season.  This announcement marks a first step into the WorldTour for HUNT and the next stage for them in serving riders across the globe.

To have the opportunity to partner with a team who exist to provide a tangible positive social impact, is humbling. HUNT strives to constantly improve and develop our products, and will utilise the input and feedback from the immensely talented riders and staff testing our wheels at the highest level of the sport, in order to better serve riders around the world.""ù  Douglas Ryder (Team Principal ""ì Team Qhubeka ASSOS): ""I am really excited about this partnership with HUNT wheels as they emerge into the WorldTour of cycling through our team. Their wheels have had excellent reviews and as a company they do everything they can to hunt for the best products to give us all the best riding experience possible. As a team we are looking forward to representing the brand as we hunt for victories across the whole WorldTour season whilst providing feedback to continuously improve the product and be better together.""ù  HUNT wheels:      Arm√©e and Schmid Blend Experience and Youth for Team Qhubeka ASSOS  Team Qhubeka ASSOS is pleased to confirm a further two riders added to our roster for 2021 in Sander Arm√©e and Mauro Schmid, to join Africa's only UCI-registered WorldTour team.  Arm√©e joins us from Lotto Soudal where he has been since 2014 and brings invaluable experience to the team, while Schmid is one of the rising young stars of Swiss cycling with a very bright future. 34-year-old Belgian Arm√©e is a strong general classification rider with excellent ability as a rouleur, and so will provide ample support to our team in our ambitions in the season's biggest stage races. A former teammate of Victor Campenaerts, Arm√©e's palmar√®s is an impressive one that includes a stage win at the Vuelta a Espana in 2017, victory in stage 3a of Tour Poitou-Charentes en Nouvelle Aquitaine in 2020 and general classification top-10 finishes at the Tour of Norway.  Schmid joins us having spent two years at Continental level, initially with the Swiss Cycling Academy and then most recently at Leopard Pro Cycling. Describing himself as a punchy all-rounder that time trials well, complemented by a background in track cycling and cross-country skiing, the 21-year-old is a product of the impressive Swiss development system and he counts Fabian Cancellara among his heroes. Growing up the Tour de Suisse was a race that he dreamt of winning and with our team he now takes the next step toward potentially realising that dream in the future.  Having previously finished second on GC at the Tour of Black Sea (2018), in 2020 he was 11th on GC at the Tour of Luxembourg and finished inside the top-20 on GC at the Czech Tour, at which he was also sixth on a stage.  This announcement sees our roster now have 25 confirmed riders for the 2021 season with our final two riders for next season to be named in due course.  Sander Arm√©e: ""I'm super-motivated to join Team Qhubeka ASSOS next year. Cycling is a passion for me and I feel the shared level of passion in the team, and with their staff. I've had some personal success in the past but that won't stop me from looking to improve even further; and so with the passion, knowledge, equipment and race mentality of Team Qhubeka ASSOS ""ì I want to make this happen. I want to use my experience and give the best of myself to achieve all of the team's goals next year. It will also be nice to team up again with Victor Campenaerts, we were in the same team for two years and have also lived in the same village for a number of years too. The goal of this team is not only winning bike races but the team also raises ",fever,,,,,,,,

Flu cases can spike in late winter after months of low infection rates, making experts reluctant to predict a mild season too soon. But many are ready to declare that COVID-19 control measures have dramatically tamped down the flu and other respiratory viruses that would normally be ripping through the Northern Hemisphere.  The World Health Organization (WHO), based on global surveillance data collected through late last month, says flu activity in the Northern Hemisphere is at ""interseasonal levels,""ù meaning it's as low as in an ordinary summer. In the United States, the percentage of outpatient visits for influenzalike illness is at 1.6%, well below the 2.6% baseline used to define a seasonal epidemic. U.S. clinical labs have collected 925 positive samples since the end of September 2020, versus 63,975 at this point in the 2019""ì20 flu season.  ""I'd be very surprised if we have a typical flu season now,""ù says John McCauley, a virologist who directs the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute in London. ""To see nothing so far, it's difficult to see how it's going to come up in large numbers in January.""ù  For now, that's a relief. Fearing a flu surge on top of the pandemic, many European countries ramped up fall immunization campaigns, says Cornelia Adlhoch, an epidemiologist at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported record flu vaccine distribution; surveys showed adult vaccination climbed from 42% in 2019 to 53% in 2020.  CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) N. DESAI/SCIENCE; (DATA) NATIONAL RESPIRATORY AND ENTERIC VIRUS SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM/CDC  ""But I don't think it's the vaccine""ù that accounts for the mercifully light flu season, McCauley says. Instead, he and others point to COVID-19 measures such as mask wearing, social distancing, and travel restrictions. As in the Southern Hemisphere early last year (Science, 21 August 2020, p. 890), efforts that failed to fully control SARS-CoV-2 have brought less infectious seasonal viruses to heel-including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes serious illness in infants and the elderly.  For virologist Trevor Bedford of the University of Washington, Seattle, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the unusual flu season means a challenge. His team analyzes flu virus genomes collected by WHO's surveillance network to identify emerging strains, which the next year's flu vaccine will have to protect against. ""Generally, we have thousands of viruses to look at, and it's still challenging,""ù he says. This season, just 127 sequences were collected between 1 September 2020 and 1 January 2021, versus 12,218 in that period the year before.  Many are a genetic variant of a flu virus that recently emerged in Cambodia, Bangladesh, and India and has caused a small seasonal outbreak, Bedford says. ""That's the strain I suspect would be the one we'd pick [as a component of ] the vaccine if we had to pick it today.""ù WHO will convene a group in February to decide on the composition of the next vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere.  Natural immunity to flu might suffer from this anomalous season. Fewer infections one season can lead to a larger susceptible population and a bigger outbreak the next. ""We saw cases go down, and as disease modelers, we knew ""¶ there might be a bit of a twist,""ù says Rachel Baker, an epidemiologist at Princeton University. In a November 2020 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Baker and colleagues simulated future flu and RSV outbreaks in more than 300 U.S. counties and Mexican states assuming a 20% reduction in transmission of those viruses this year. For some locations, their model predicted outbreaks in the winter of 2021""ì22 that were double the size of typical years'.  More susceptibility could also lead to outbreaks outside peak virus season, Baker says. She suspects that's happening in Australia: After unusually low rates of RSV in the Southern Hemisphere's winter, the country began to lift lockdowns. Some Australian states documented a spike in October 2020, as summer approached, and continue to report above-average levels.  Flu outbreaks are less predictable, however, and might not rebound in the same way, Baker says; in her team's model, suppressing flu transmission one season didn't consistently boost incidence in the next. And if worries about a spike next year inspire more flu shots, ""a larger outbreak might be thwarted,""ù she says.  Bedford says a less welcome development might also mitigate a flu surge next year: a revival of COVID-19 and a reinstatement of any loosened control measures. ""If we don't get enough people vaccinated over the course of the summer, mainly [because of ] vaccine hesitancy,""ù he says, ""we'll get some smaller wave of COVID.""ù  But even as the threat of COVID-19 subsides in future winters, mitigation measures might linger, says Benjamin Singer, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Northwestern University. ""As we start thinking about the balance of all respiratory viruses-COVID, plus flu, plus the others-are we in the United States and in the West going to start thinking more about wearing masks in public in winter months?""ù he wonders. ""It's an interesting sociologic kind of question: how our behavior will be impacted by our experience with COVID.""ù",influenza,,,,,,,,

At the time, Wozniak claimed his wife was suffering from a 'bad cough', but on Thursday he went into far more detail about the severity of their symptoms during an interview with TMZ.  'We had all the symptoms exactly the way people described them,' Wozniak told the entertainment publication.  'Janet was coughing up blood and they tested her for eight hours straight at a US hospital and couldn't find anything they had test for. It was that new.'  'This was the worst flu of our lives. At first it felt like a little sore throat... [but] by the end of the day, I knew that this was one of those ones that stays and becomes laryngitis.'  'That cough came, and it got so hard... I was throwing up and had diarrhea at the same time.'  Wozniak claims the symptoms lasted for around 'three or four weeks' before they subside in February.

Wozniak traveled on a cruise around Vietnam, Cambodia and Singapore with his wife, Janet, late last year, before they stopped off in China.

The first case of COVID-19 was not officially reported in the US until January 20, but a new US study from the CDC shows it was spreading much earlier than that time.  Research published December 2 revealed that 39 blood samples taken between December 13 and 16 last year in California, Oregon and Washington state had tested positive for COVID antibodies, meaning the people who gave them had been infected weeks earlier.  The evidence is the earliest trace so far of the virus on US soil, and a further 67 samples from between December 30 and January 17 tested positive in Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island and Wisconsin.  It adds to a growing body of proof that the virus had spread thousands of miles outside of China long before its existence was acknowledged.

PLoS ONE 16(1): e0240677. htt","The decision-making power of the family might also affect the nutritional status of adolescent girls. Decision-making for receiving nutrition services was found to be under the control of fathers' in 66.1% of the study participants. As indicated by a study conducted in Jimma Zone, Southwest of Ethiopia, women autonomy in decision-making is important to improve nutritional status women and their children [ 39 , 40 ]. Similarly, 45.1% of the study participants did not receive a deworming tablet. As indicated by a study conducted in Angolela, Ethiopia, stunting of study participants was associated with intestinal parasite [ 41 ]. Therefore, this might further aggravate the low nutritional status of the study subjects [ 42 ].  The reasons for the observed undernutrition among the current study participants might be due to their low monthly household income, large family size, low educational status of fathers' of the adolescent girls and poor hand-washing practice with soap before eating food. Our finding is supported by a study conducted in the Somali Region of Ethiopia, which indicated that hand washing with soap after using the toilet and before eating affects the nutritional status of adolescent girls [ 18 ]. This might be due to the association between diarrheal disease with not washing hands, which can also affect the nutritional status of adolescent girls [ 37 ]. Moreover, 40.4% of the study participants purchased their food from the market, whose amounts and quality can depend on their income, distance to markets, and price fluctuations [ 38 ].  The BAZs revealed that 19.5% of the adolescent girls were moderately thin and 8% were severely thin. Similarly, 7.8% of adolescent girls are moderately stunted and 1% are severely stunted. The prevalence of thinness is higher in this study than in a study conducted in the Amhara Region [ 36 ]. Similarly, the prevalence of stunting in the current study was lower than in the study conducted at the Amhara Region [ 17 ] and in Adwa, northern Ethiopia [ 20 ]. The prevalence in this study were also lower than those reported from a study conducted in Bangladesh [ 19 ].  Factors associated with the nutritional status (BAZ) and HAZ of adolescent girls in Southern Ethiopia  Adolescent girls between the ages of 10""ì14 years were 2.9 times more likely to be thin than adolescent girls ‚â• 15 years old. This finding is in line with the study conducted in the Amhara Region [17]. This might be due to the rapid growth and reproductive maturation during adolescence(10""ì14 years age), which increases energy and nutrient requirements and hence the need for quality diets [43, 44].  Adolescent girls with a family size > 5 were 1.6 times more likely to be thin than those from a family with ‚â§ 5 people. This finding is supported by studies conducted in the city of Arar [45], Nigeria [46], and the Amhara Region [17]. Large families may share food among family members [20], constraining the availability of adequate amount of quality food [47].  Adolescent girls from families whose monthly income was < 1000 ETB (31.25 USD) were 2.5 times more likely to be thinner than those from families who have monthly incomes > 2000ETB (62.5 USD). This finding is in line with studies conducted in Bangladesh [48, 49] and Nigeria [22]. This might be because the household's low monthly income, which affects the purchasing power leading to the consumption of suboptimal quantity and quality food. Consequently, adolescent girls from low monthly income were more likely to be thinner [50].  Study participants who did not take deworming tablets every six months were 1.56 times more likely to be thinner than those who took a deworming tablet every six months. According to the WHO preventive deworming recommendations, a biannual single-dose of albendazole (400 mg) is recommended as a public health intervention for all non-pregnant adolescent girls and women of reproductive age in order to reduce the burden of soil-transmitted helminthes which can affect nutritional status of adolescent girls [51]. Indeed, a systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that taking deworming tablets improves the nutritional status of adolescent girls [52], by causing diarrhea and reducing absorption of nutrients. The odds of stunting were also lower among adolescents that washed their hands prior to eating meals (P< 0.05).  Study participants whose fathers had no formal education were 2.3 times more likely to be thinner than those whose fathers completed college and university level education. This finding is in line with a study conducted in the cities of Tehran [53] and in Adama in Central Ethiopia [54]. This might be due to educated families having better access to information, nutrition education, and quality diets [55].  Decision-making power for nutrition services was statistically associated with the nutritional status of the study participants. Adolescent girls that had both parents jointly making decisions on access to nutrition services were significantly less likely to be thin and stunted than adolescents whose decision to access to nutrition services were solely made by the father or the mother. Other studies have shown that women's participation in decision making is important for improving the nutritional status of women and children [56].  Adolescent girls acquiring their food from their household production or from purchases form the market were 3.28 and 5.14 times, respectively, more likely to be thinner than those who were getting their food from both home production and market purchases.  Visits by health extension workers were statistically associated with the nutritional status of adolescent girls. Adolescent girls who were not visited by health extension workers in their homes were 1.72 times more likely to be thinner than those who were visited by health extension workers at their homes within the past three months. This might be due to nutritional counseling that can result in the improvement of nutritional knowledge and behavioral change for improved nutrition [57]. Similarly, adolescents visited by health extension workers in the last three months had lower odds of being stunted.",diarrhea,,,,,,,,

Tri traveled from Myanmar to Thailand by truck on Dec. 15 and stayed there until Dec. 22, when he and six others got on another truck bound for Cambodia on Dec. 23. On Dec. 24, Tri was driven to a border gate in Tay Ninh, then to HCMC, then got on a different bus to Vinh Long. Throughout his journey, he had made contact with several other people.  After disembarking at Vinh Long, Tri traveled to his mother's house. His mother however reported him to authorities so he could be quarantined on Dec. 24.  As part of existing Covid-19 prevention measures, anyone who wish to enter Vietnamese border must report doing so to border guards, and must be quarantined immediately upon entry. Throughout his journey, Tri sat on the back of multiple trucks, among other methods, to evade authorities.  Local police and border guards are investigating his entry.  ""We have requested units along the border to enhance control, and severely punish any violations,"" Ngoc said.  The Health Ministry later on Thursday has confirmed Tri to be Vietnam's latest Covid-19 patient, raising the country's infection tally to 1,440.

We conducted cross-sectional surveys in 2016 and 2017 at two clinics in Wewak, Papua New Guinea (PNG) where we identified three infections caused by C580Y mutants among 239 genotyped clinical samples. One of these mutants exhibited the highest survival rate (6.8%) among all parasites surveyed in ring-stage survival assays (RSA) for artemisinin. Analyses of kelch13 flanking regions, and comparisons of deep sequencing data from 389 clinical samples from PNG, Indonesian Papua and Western Cambodia, suggested an independent origin of the Wewak C580Y mutation, showing that the mutants possess several distinctive genetic features. Identity by descent (IBD) showed that multiple portions of the mutants' genomes share a common origin with parasites found in Indonesian Papua, comprising several mutations within genes previously associated with drug resistance, such as mdr1, ferredoxin, atg18 and pnp. These findings suggest that a P. falciparum lineage circulating on the island of New Guinea has gradually acquired a complex ensemble of variants, including kelch13 C580Y, which have affected the parasites' drug sensitivity. This worrying development reinforces the need for increased surveillance of the evolving parasite populations on the island, to contain the spread of resistance.  Artemisinin is the most widely used drug against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In southeast Asia, parasites have evolved genetic changes making them resistant to artemisinin. The elimination of resistant strains is a global priority, since their global spread could result in massive loss of lives. In Papua New Guinea, we found three patients infected with parasites carrying the most widespread resistant variant in southeast Asia, and they were confirmed to be artemisinin resistant. We established that the mutations were not imported from southeast Asia, and found other drug resistance variants in their genetic background, including some shared with parasites in Indonesia. This indicates that artemisinin resistance has emerged in New Guinea separately from southeast Asia, not by a chance event, but by a gradual process of evolution which may still be ongoing undetected on the island. These resistant strains could undermine malaria local control efforts, and constitute a global threat.

While the GMS has been at the epicentre of resistance to antimalarials multiple times over the last sixty years, resistance has also repeatedly arisen independently on the island of New Guinea, producing alternative resistant genetic variants [ 15 , 16 ]; This makes New Guinea a likely candidate for the emergence of novel forms of artemisinin resistance, and underlines the importance of monitoring local strains. The island of New Guinea is divided between the countries of Papua New Guinea (also known as ""PNG""ù) to the east, and Indonesia to the west (referred to as ""Indonesian Papua""ù here). PNG has used artemether-lumefantrine as first-line treatment for malaria since late 2011[ 17 ], and delayed parasite clearance has not been reported to date [ 18 ]. We previously reported the absence of kelch13 mutations in PNG samples obtained in 2002""ì2003 in Wewak Town, East Sepik [ 9 ], consistent with results from a later broader survey [ 10 ]; however, studies of genetic variants across the island have only been conducted at a limited number of sites. A report of an Australian citizen infected with a C580Y mutant after returning from PNG raised the prospect that artemisinin resistance may have emerged undetected [ 19 ]. To investigate this possibility, we conducted a cross-sectional study in 2016""ì2017 in Wewak. Here, we analyze clinical and genetic data from 257 cases surveyed in this study, to evaluate the potential emergence of artemisinin resistance. We assessed sensitivity to artemisinin using the ring-stage survival assay (RSA), a sensitive ex-vivo method [ 20 ], and used next-generation sequencing data to reconstruct the epidemiology of kelch13 mutants found.  In the GMS, slow artemisinin clearance rates have been associated with genetic mutations in two domains of the parasite's kelch13 gene [ 7 ]. Numerous independently arising kelch13 mutations have been found in GMS resistant parasites [ 3 , 8 ""ì 10 ], and several of these mutations have been validated in relation with clinical and in vitro artemisinin resistance [ 11 ]. Increasingly, the genotyping of kelch13 is being used for the surveillance of artemisinin resistance [ 3 , 8 ""ì 10 ]. After an initial period in which many kelch13 resistant alleles circulated concurrently, diversity has declined dramatically in the eastern part of the GMS (comprising Cambodia, northeast Thailand, southern Laos and Vietnam) where the C580Y allele has become the most prevalent, replacing other circulating mutations [ 12 ]. This allele is also associated with reduced clearing rate western Thailand [ 5 ] where it has emerged independently [ 13 ]. The C580Y allele has also been detected in parasites outside the GMS, in Africa [ 8 ] and in Guyana, South America [ 14 ]; however, in these instances the artemisinin clearance rates were not known.  The global adoption of artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs), consisting of an artemisinin derivative and a partner drug, has played a key role in the worldwide reduction of malaria cases and deaths [ 1 ]. In the last decade, however, Plasmodium falciparum parasites with decreased sensitivity to artemisinin have emerged at multiple locations in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region (GMS) [ 2 ""ì 4 ]. These resistant parasites exhibit a reduced clearing rate during treatment [ 2 , 3 , 5 ], such that treatment efficacy relies more heavily on the partner drug. As a result, resistance to the partner drug may emerge, as has recently been the case with the partner drug piperaquine, leading to ACT treatment failures [ 4 , 6 ].  The most differentiated SNP was ferredoxin (PF3D7_1318100) D193Y on chromosome 13, previously identified as a component of the genetic background associated with artemisinin resistance in the GMS [ 21 ]. In the large IBD region on chromosome 10 we found three noteworthy hits: the T38I mutation in the autophagy-related protein 18 gene (atg18, PF3D7_1012900), associated with artemisinin response and widespread in the GMS; and two SNPs (N280S and N659S) in the NLI interacting factor-like phosphatase (nif4, PF3D7_1012700), implicated in conjunction with atg18 [ 25 ] and identified as associated with artemisinin response [ 21 ]. On chromosome 5, another extensive IBD region contains mutations Y184F and N1042D in the mdr1 gene (PF3D7_0523000), which has been implicated in resistance to multiple antimalarials [ 26 , 27 ], including artemisinin; the Y184F variant is common in the GMS, where it has been under selection [ 28 ]. Also on chromosome 5, we found the Q225H mutations in the purine nucleoside phosphorylase gene (pnp, PF3D7_0513300), which circulates in the GMS and associated with drug resistance [ 29 ]. Some highly differentiated variants are located in genes associated in drug resistance, although the mutations themselves were not directly implicated. We found K753Q in the amino acid transporter PF3D7_0515500, previously implicated in artemether response [ 30 ]; G248R in gene PF3D7_1450800, associated to artemisinin resistance in a large-scale study [ 21 ]; two amino acid changes in an ABC transporter (PF3D7_0319700) shown experimentally to be a drug target [ 31 ]; and the G233R mutation in plasmepsin III (pmIII/hap, PF3D7_1408100) which is involved in resistance to piperaquine [ 32 ]. IBD networks restricted to flanking regions of specific drug resistance genes such as atg18 and pnp confirmed that Wewak mutants clearly cluster with the Timika population ( Fig 4C and 4D ).  Because of the length of the shared IBD segments, it is not possible to pinpoint exactly what variants may have driven their acquisition. However, it is possible to narrow down the list of potential candidates, based on the expectation that the driving mutations would cause amino acid changes, and would be common in Indonesian Papua and rare in PNG. Therefore, we extracted those nonsynonymous variants that are highly differentiated SNPs between the Wewak and Timika populations (F ST ‚â• 0.3), and at which the C580Y mutants carry the Timika-like allele (n = 144, 0.6% of all nonsynonymous variants), ordering them by decreasing F ST ( S6 Table ). The resulting list of variants may be used as a shortlist for further functional investigations; it may be of particular interest that several of the most differentiated variants, particularly those in regions of high IBD with Timika parasites, have been previously implicated in drug response, or are located in genes associated with drug resistance.  We applied IBD analysis to other Wewak parasites, also collected in 2017, which lacked kelch13 mutations but had high proportions of Indonesian ancestry (as determined by fastSTRUCTURE). We found that the two samples with the highest Indonesian ancestry proportions (42% and 40%) show a near-identical pattern of high-IBD regions to that of the C580Y mutants; a third parasite with a lower degree of Indonesian ancestry (29%) also harboured several corresponding high-IBD regions ( S6 Fig ). It therefore appears that parasites carrying very similar sets of acquired genomic regions, both with and without the C580Y mutation, circulated simultaneously in Wewak.  Although some stretches of the C580Y genomes share IBD with both Timika and Wewak parasites, possibly indicating earlier gene flow between these populations, at several loci the IBD haplotypes are only observed in Indonesian parasites- notably in chromosomes 3, 5, 10 and 13. The sizes of these haplotypes (generally > 100 kbp) suggests recent acquisition from a donor population- putatively, one closely related to those in Indonesian Papua. The high level of IDB in these regions indicates that a large proportion of Timika parasites possess the same long haplotype, which is characteristic of genomic regions under evolutionary selection. [ 24 ]  Fourteen plots are shown, one per chromosome in the P. falciparum nuclear genome; the x-axis of each plot represents nucleotide positions along the chromosome. At the top of each plot, two rows of diamond markers indicate the position of SNPs that are highly differentiated between the Wewak and Timika populations (F ST ‚â• 0.3); the marker colour indicates whether the allele present in the Wewak C580Y mutants matches the most common one in Timika (green diamonds) or Wewak (red diamonds). The line charts below the markers show the proportion of sample pairs in the Timika (green lines) and Wewak (red) population that are IDB with the Wewak C580Y parasites at each chromosome position.  The observation that Wewak C580Y mutants share a higher proportion of IBD with Timika than with local wild-type parasites might appear to contradict the finding that the proportion of PNG ancestry in these mutants is greater than that of Indonesia, as was determined by fastSTRUCTURE. However, these results could be reconciled if most of the mutants' genomes was produced by long-term mixing of PNG parasites, resulting in a random distribution of alleles common in PNG, and is interspersed with a smaller proportion of segments recently acquired from Indonesian populations, which are identified as IBD. To test this hypothesis, we selected SNPs that are highly differentiated between the Wewak and Timika populations (F ST ‚â• 0.3), and labelled them according to which of the two populations has the allele present in the C580Y mutants as its dominant allele. Of the 467 selected SNPs, 57.6% (n = 269) carried the Wewak allele, consistent with a predominantly PNG-like genetic background. When mapped across the genome, the majority of Timika-like alleles are not randomly distributed, but clustered in regions of IBD between the C580Y mutants and the Timika populations ( Fig 5 ). For example, 63% of variants where the mutants carry the Timika-like allele are in regions where there is IBD with ‚â• 10% of the Timika population (30% of all variants); outside of these regions, 77% of SNPs exhibit Wewak-like alleles.  These isoRelate network plots show IBD relationships between all samples analyzed for different genomic regions. Wewak C580Y mutants are shown by a magenta circle, pointed to by an arrow; note that only two mutants were included in this analysis, due to high degree of genotype missingness in the third mutant. (A) Whole-genome IBD shows that, although most parasites cluster strongly by geography, the C580Y mutants form a separate group, probably reflecting their admixed structure. (B) IBD in chromosome 13 regions flanking the kelch13 gene shows that Wewak parasites do not cluster in a single group, and the C580Y mutants form a group on their own; no New Guinea parasites cluster with the Cambodian group, confirming that kelch13 haplotypes on the island have independent origin. (C) IBD in chromosome 10 regions flanking the atg18 gene shows that C580Y mutants cluster with the Timika samples, as is also the case in the chromosome 5 regions flanking the pnp gene (D). In B-D, flanking regions are 75 kbp regions on either flank.  This plot shows the distributions of the level of IBD (i.e. the percentage of the genome that is predicted to be in IBD) between parasites samples in Wewak and those sampled at other sites on the island of New Guinea. For each of the five sites, two boxplots show the distribution of pairwise IBD levels for parasites from that site: either against the Wewak C580Y mutants (blue, labelled ""C580Y""ù), or against the Wewak kelch13 wild-type parasites (pink, ""WT""ù). For the Wewak site (first two boxplots) we compare the two groups against Wewak WT samples only; hence, the blue boxplot shows IBD levels between Wewak C580Y mutants and Wewak WT parasites, while the pink boxplot shows IBD levels among Wewak WT parasites only.  To evaluate these hypotheses, we performed a genome-wide estimation of identity by descent (IBD) between each pair of samples. IBD models recombination processes, identifying genome regions that are likely to be identical because of common ancestry. For each of the New Guinea sites, we estimated IBD proportion between local parasites and the Wewak C580Y mutants; and between local parasites and the Wewak parasites carrying kelch13 wild-type ( Fig 3 ). The results indicate that the mutants possess significantly higher IBD with Timika parasites than the Wewak wild-type parasites (medians IBD proportion: 14.4% vs 8.0%, p<10 ‚àí117 by Mann-Whitney test), and significantly less IBD with parasites from most PNG sites (Wewak medians: 8.9% vs 11%, p<10 ‚àí48 ; Madang medians: 9.5% vs 11.3%, p<10 ‚àí7 ; Maprik medians: 7.8% vs 10.7%, p<10 ‚àí37 ). An IBD network based on genome-wide data shows that parasites from Wewak, Timika and Cambodia form three large haplotype-sharing clusters, while the Wewak mutants constitute a small separate group, confirming their genome composition is distinct from these populations ( Fig 4A ). Also, an IBD network based on the regions flanking the kelch13 gene shows that the haplotypes accompanying the C580Y mutations are distinct from those circulating elsewhere- including those in Cambodia and Papua Indonesia ( Fig 4B ).  The level of admixture in the C580Y mutants suggest substantial genetic contribution from the Indonesian population. One possibility is that the Wewak mutants originate from a geographically intermediate location, and are the result of long-term continuous recombination between Indonesian and PNG populations. A different hypothesis is that the mutants have acquired through recombination, and retained, portions of genomes circulating in Indonesian Papua which provide some selective advantage. The first scenario would result in a random distribution of shared alleles, while the second would likely produce a limited number of long shared haplotypes.  Similar results were obtained from flanking haplotypes constructed by concatenating WGS genotypes at SNPs with minor allele frequency ‚â• 0.01 in a region of 300kbp centred at kelch13 ( S5 Fig ). Downstream, the C580Y mutant flanking haplotype is similar to those circulating in Cambodia, but also to those in kelch13 wild-type parasites in New Guinea, particularly in Timika. Upstream, considerably longer matches (~60kbp) are found in Indonesian and PNG samples than in Cambodian ones. Taken together, the above results provide no support for a GMS origin of the PNG kelch13 C580Y haplotype. Since the mutant genomes show low similarity to GMS parasites, it is reasonable to conclude that the mutation most likely emerged independently in New Guinea.  Although the mutants were not recently imported from the GMS, it is still possible that a C580Y mutation from the GMS could have been acquired by New Guinea parasites through recombination, analogous to the crt haplotype of Asian origin that circulates in chloroquine-resistant African P. falciparum [ 22 ]. To investigate this possibility, we tested 12 microsatellite loci and six SNPs in regions flanking kelch13 [ 14 , 23 ] in the 2017 parasites from Wewak, and eight other isolates for comparison ( S5 Table ), producing 64 unique haplotypes in 96 parasites. Upstream from kelch13 (left flank), we found strong similarities between the haplotype sequence of the Wewak C580Y mutants, and those of both Cambodian resistant parasites (e.g. MRA-1236) and PNG wild type haplotypes (e.g. H5 and H13, found in 7 samples). Downstream from kelch13, however, the C580Y mutants bear greater similarity to the sequences of PNG haplotypes (e.g. H46 and H48) than to those in Cambodia. Overall, the H5 and H13 haplotypes from PNG were the most similar to those of the mutants, suggesting an independent local emergence rather than a GMS origin.  Further evidence of admixture was provided by population structure analysis performed by fastSTRUCTURE ( S4 Fig ). This analysis indicated that the underlying population structure was best explained by K = 6 putative ancestral populations ( Fig 2B ). Applying this model, we observe that New Guinea parasites mostly derive from two major ancestral populations, one in Papua Indonesia and one in PNG, with the exception of a small subpopulation in Wewak (gray bars). However, substantially admixture in several samples in both countries (e.g. about 16% of samples from both PNG and Papua Indonesia shared >10% ancestry with the dominant group of the other region) suggests frequent exchanges between the two populations. The Wewak C580Y mutants were found to be amongst the most admixed in PNG, all three individuals estimated to have inherited 35""ì36% of their genome from the Indonesian ancestral population. Like all New Guinea samples, Wewak C580Y mutants carry no contribution from GMS ancestral populations, ruling out the hypothesis that they are recent imports from that region.  (A) Plot of the first two components (PC2 vs PC1) of principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) using genetic distances computed from whole-genome sequence data from all samples in New Guinea. We note a marked separation between parasites from Papua Indonesia (green squares) and PNG (circles), with a minority of samples from both regions at an intermediate position, suggesting admixture. (B) Population structure at all sites, estimated by fastSTRUCTURE, based on the hypothesis of K = 6 ancestral populations; each ancestral populations is indicated by a different colour, and each vertical bar represents a single sample, coloured according to the estimated ancestry proportions. The plot suggests no recent common ancestry between New Guinea parasites and those in Cambodia. Furthermore, it shows strong differentiations between parasites in Papua Indonesia and PNG (consistent with PCoA results above), with a minority of samples from both sides (including the Wewak C580Y mutants) exhibiting significant levels of admixture. This analysis also identified a subpopulation of Wewak parasites (gray) which correspond to the cluster of samples in the lower left-hand corner of the PCoA plot.  To cluster individuals by genetic similarity, we conducted a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on genome-wide pairwise genetic distances. This showed a clear separation between Cambodian and New Guinean parasites, with no samples bridging the gap between these two populations ( S3 Fig ). We also conducted a PCoA without Cambodian parasites ( Fig 2A ), in which the first component (PC1) clearly separated Papua Indonesia from PNG, showing that parasite populations at the PNG sites are more similar to each other than they are to Indonesian parasites. However, a number of individuals from both countries, including the Wewak C580Y parasites, occupy an intermediate position along PC1, consistent with admixture between the two populations. Furthermore, we observe two Timika parasites clustering with PNG parasites, suggesting recent importation from PNG into Timika.  To study in greater detail the provenance of the C580Y mutants, we compared whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 389 high-quality samples with low within-sample diversity, including 73 from the present study, 83 from other PNG locations, 88 from Timika in Indonesian Papua, and 145 from western Cambodia ( Table 2 and Fig 1 ). All three C580Y mutants were included in this analysis, and no other parasite from Indonesia or PNG carried kelch13 mutations.  To investigate whether the Wewak C580Y mutants were imported from Southeast Asia, we first tested for the genetic background underpinning kelch13 mutations in the GMS [ 21 ]. Of six markers tested, only one (ferredoxin D193Y) was found in Wewak C580Y mutants, compared to four or five in GMS artemisinin-resistant clones ( S4 Table ). The ferredoxin variant was detected in all three Wewak C580Y mutants, but was only found in one in ten randomly selected Wewak parasites with wild-type kelch13. All 2017 samples were tested for amplifications of plasmepsin2/3 and pfmdr1, which are associated with resistance to the partner drugs piperaquine and mefloquine. All carried a single copy of plasmepsin2/3, and only a single parasite (kelch13 wild-type) had an amplified pfmdr1 ( S1 Table ).  We used RSA [ 20 ] to measure artemisinin susceptibility in samples with parasitemia >0.1% (n = 117), including two C580Y mutants. The assays yielded interpretable results for 57 parasites ( S3 Table ), including PNG-C580Y-1. Undetermined results were mainly due to insufficient parasite growth (n = 52) or low-quality blood smears (n = 8). Survival rate could not be determined for PNG-C580Y-3. Five samples (8.8%) exhibited a survival rate >1% (range: 1.6""ì6.8%) at 72 hours following dihydroartemisinin exposure, a threshold that correlates with parasite clearance half-life >5 hours in the GMS [ 20 ]. The PNG-C580Y-1 mutant produced the highest survival rate (6.8%), comparable to rates measured in Cambodian C580Y parasites [ 7 ], suggesting that Wewak C580Y mutants possess levels of ring-stage artemisinin resistance similar to those in the GMS ( S2 Fig ).  This study enrolling 257 patients with uncomplicated malaria in 2016 and 2017 at two clinics in Wewak Town, East Sepik in PNG ( Fig 1 ). Eighteen patients (7.0%) had taken antimalarial drugs in the previous two weeks, and were excluded from further analysis ( Table 1 ). We were able to genotype the kelch13 gene in 239 parasitized blood samples ( S1 Table ). The C580Y allele was found in 2017 in three samples (2.3%), labelled PNG-C580Y-1 to PNG-C580Y-3 ( S2 Table ). The patients carrying the mutant parasites were aged 7, 16 and 25 years, and presented with parasite densities of 0.35, 0.07 and 0.44%, respectively. They lived within 2 km of each other and had no history of foreign travel ( S1 Fig ).  Discussion  Over several decades, the spread of drug resistance from the GMS has rendered multiple drugs ineffective in Africa, at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. Therefore, the current rise of artemisinin resistance in southeast Asia is an urgent concern, since fast-acting artemisinin combination therapies are the preferred frontline treatments in nearly all endemic countries. The GMS is not the only region with the conditions for the development of drug resistance: resistance to multiple drugs, such as chloroquine [33] and sulfadoxine [16] emerged independently in New Guinea, making the island a likely source of new resistant strains.  In this study, we identified three infections from parasites carrying the kelch13 C580Y mutation, the most widespread artemisinin resistant allele. C580Y has rapidly overtaken other kelch13 variants, becoming dominant in large parts of the GMS [12], and was confirmed by a transfection study to confer resistance in vitro [34]. The discovery of three C580Y mutants in Wewak, almost identical at genomic level, raised multiple important questions. First, are these parasites actually resistant to artemisinin? Second, were these mutants imported into PNG as a result of the recent aggressive spread of C580Y in the GMS, or are they parasites native to New Guinea that have acquired the mutation either through independent emergence, or through recombination with Asian mutants? Third, do these mutants represent a confined local phenomenon, or are they representatives of a spreading population across the island, perhaps across national borders? Fourth, if the C580Y mutations were not imported, did they result from an isolated ""chance event""ù, or from a gradual evolutionary process that selected a genetic background to boost fitness? The results presented here provide convincing evidence to answer all these questions.  Although clinical parasite clearance rates were not measured in this study, in vitro tests of one of the Wewak mutants showed it to be resistant to artemisinin in their ring stage, consistent with C580Y mutants elsewhere. Since no failures occurred in patients infected with these parasites after artemether-lumefantrine treatment, there is no reason to suspect that this ACT is no longer efficacious, and the clinical significance of the C580Y allele in New Guinea will be clarified by in vivo efficacy studies. However, parasite populations stand to benefit from decreased sensitivity even without treatment failures: slower clearance increases drug exposure, boosting the parasites' chances to develop further resistance. Recent research in the GMS showed that continued drug exposure leads to accumulation of mutations that confer higher levels of resistance, facilitating the spread of multidrug resistant lineages [12].  We found no evidence that the Wewak C580Y mutations have been imported from the GMS. At whole-genome level, the mutants appear more similar to New Guinean parasites than to Cambodian ones, and analyses of flanking haplotypes and IBD showed no evidence of acquisition from imported parasites. Overall, there is a strong case for an independent emergence of the C580Y mutation on the island of New Guinea, although our data is insufficient to pinpoint a precise geographic origin.  At genome-wide level, the Wewak C580Y mutants are substantially different from the most other PNG samples. Their genetic background is mostly ""PNG-like""ù, in that it carries alleles commonly found in Wewak, in relatively short IDB fragments suggesting long-term interbreeding. However, a substantial proportion of C580Y mutants' genome consists of long haplotypes shared with many Timika parasites, suggesting these segments were acquired from a common source population strongly connected to the Papua Indonesia parasites. Furthermore, the length and frequency of the shared haplotypes suggests that they contain regions under selection in that source population.[24] This may be consistent with a recent report that a distinct parasite subpopulation has emerged in Timika and rapidly risen in frequency to 100% of infections in 2016""ì2017, potentially indicating a selective sweep, [35] even though the frontline ACT is still reported to be efficacious.[36]  Although the available data does not allow precise identification of the genetic variants that drove the segments' acquisition, we catalogued alleles located in the IBD fragments that were shared with the Indonesian Papua parasites and absent from other PNG samples. In this shortlist of potential drivers, we found several variants previously associated with drug resistance (and artemisinin resistance in particular), and therefore prime candidates for further analyses. In one of these shared segments we found the ferredoxin D193Y mutation, identical to the artemisinin resistance-linked variant circulating in the GMS [21] and otherwise absent from PNG. The drug resistant allele mdr1 Y184F, known to be under selection in the GMS [28], is also present in a large IBD segment, with another less common mdr1 mutation, N1042D. mdr1 is a transporter contributing to the efflux of toxic substances from the parasite's food vacuole, and its polymorphisms have been associated with resistance to multiple drugs. Another IBD segment on chromosome 10 harbours the atg18 T38I variant, associated with decreased sensitivities to dihydroartemisinin and artemether (the artemisinin derivative used in PNG) in the China-Myanmar border area [25], and two non-synonymous changes in the nearby nif4 gene; other mutations in nif4 were previously associated with artemisinin sensitivity in two independent genome-wide association studies in Southeast Asia [21,25]. We also observed a mutation in a nucleoside phosphorylase (pnp Q225H), recently shown to affect response to quinine and mefloquine [29], two drugs related to lumefantrine, the partner drug used in PNG.  Taken together, the above results frame the Wewak C580Y mutants in a complex evolutionary context. This kelch13 mutation has emerged independently in New Guinea, and was found not on an ordinary Wewak genetic background, but on one that has acquired a patchwork of sizeable genomic segments from another population. These acquisitions have introduced genomic regions that were likely to be under selection in Papua Indonesia, and contain alleles new to PNG, which have been associated to drug resistance in other parts of the world. This strongly suggests that these mutants are the product of a process driven by recombination events and selection under artemisinin drug pressure, and that the kelch13 C580Y mutation is a component of a complex constellation of genetic changes, rather than a standalone mutation. The presence of parasites carrying a similar compendium of acquired genomic segments, but no kelch13 C580Y mutation, supports the hypothesis that the latter is a very recent acquisition on a",malaria,,,,,,,,

All is snug and cosy - gemtlich, as they like to say in these parts - except for the most peculiar noise: silence.  I am in Ischgl, the Austrian ski resort famous for the most boisterous apres-ski party scene in the Alps. Normally, sundown would herald the thud of dance music in a resort known as Ibiza On Ice.  For years, its marketing slogan was - and still is - 'Relax. If you can.'  For now, though, the place is virtually empty and the residents are not remotely relaxed. All are acutely aware that Ischgl has been saddled, however unfairly, with a very different claim to fame: as the super-spreading Covid capital of Europe.  As a new and uncertain season flickers into life, I find Ischgl determined not to see history repeat itself here.  Back in March, as the coronavirus quickly morphed from a news item in China to a global crisis, scientists tried to find out why fresh clusters of the virus were suddenly popping up all over Europe. Within days, several lines of inquiry had yielded the same name: Ischgl.  What's more, the same nightspot kept recurring, too. A popular apres-ski bar called Kitzloch had thrown up the town's first official case of Covid after a bartender tested positive on March 7.  I am in Ischgl, the Austrian ski resort famous for the most boisterous apres-ski party scene in the Alps. For now, though, the place is virtually empty and the residents are not remotely relaxed. Robert is pictured on the slopes  Within two days, members of staff had followed suit. In no time, former Kitzloch drinkers from the UK to Cambodia were reporting fevers, coughs, a loss of smell. Worryingly, many had returned home weeks earlier.  Yet instead of winding down their ski season, the local authorities insisted Ischgl was safe.  The government of Iceland may have put Ischgl on the same 'high-risk' list as China and Iran after 15 skiers flew back to Reykjavik with the virus. Yet Austria's response was to blame the infections on the flight, not the ski resort.  And so skiing continued for an extra germ-filled week until Austria suddenly announced the entire valley would be closed within hours. Cue: chaos. Hotel lobbies and buses were suddenly packed with people desperate to escape Ischgl, thus adding to the spread.  An official inquiry has since criticised officials for 'momentous miscalculations'.  More than 6,000 Ischgl holidaymakers from 45 nations - including the families of 32 people who died - have registered with an Austrian consumer group seeking redress.  Their lawyer, Dr Peter Kolba, claims that up to 11,000 people were infected thanks to that week of fatal dithering, and then went on to infect many more. He puts it down to greed. 'Ischgl earns 2 million euros a day in the season. They wanted every extra day,' he says.  Here, at what some are calling Europe's Covid Ground Zero, I hear a different story. The locals feel that Ischgl's global party image has made it a very convenient scapegoat. Resorts across Europe, they argue, were doing exactly the same.  But where better to assess the start of the strangest ski season since World War II?  My arrival comes just before the current temporary travel ban on the British. In a normal winter, this weekend would have seen UK airports and ferry ports packed with skiers heading for the slopes. Thanks to the new souped-up strain of Covid-19, however, Brits are either banned or face a ten-day quarantine in each direction.  Ibiza On Ice: Tourists at a festival in Ischgl, famous for its wild apres-ski scene  It won't last, of course. We are paying the price for a world-leading genomic sequencing regime which has picked up what our European neighbours are about to learn for themselves. And once they find they, too, are riddled with the same bug, we can reset the dial.  What then for the estimated one million Brits who love to ski each year?  One thing is pretty clear. The Alpine nations are incapable of a common policy and, instead, are chucking snowballs at each other.  Austria has just opened its ski lifts for locals only. There will be no accommodation (and, therefore, no outsiders) until some time in January. Even so, some Austrian resorts were reporting traffic chaos and overcrowding yesterday.  In France, by contrast, hotels are open but all ski lifts are shut. Being outside the EU, the Swiss are raising two fingers to their neighbours and have opened hotels, ski lifts and even restaurants (the latter must close by 7pm).  Germany and Italy are adamant the others are wrong and have shut everything.  'No ski lifts open anywhere and no holidays anywhere,' says the fun-loving Prime Minister of Bavaria, Markus S√∂der, adding: 'The goal is to avoid a second Ischgl.'  So, here I am in Ischgl to see how Covid Ground Zero is feeling now.  'I have worked in tourism for 30 years and have never seen anything like what we saw this year,' says Andy Steibl, Ischgl's head of tourism.  'We have been in the media for more than eight months, so we know that what we do next is very important.'  Ischgl has spent ¬£650,000 on new cameras to minimise lift queues and new machinery to disinfect cable cars.  Everyone who buys a ski-lift pass will be given a 'tube scarf', or 'snood', that pulls up to become a face mask. People can ski, but there will be no 'apres' all season.  'We know the world is watching,' says Andy. It certainly is. The other day, Austria's answer to Panorama arrived in Ischgl to a hostile reception. One man coughed all over the camera crew and told them he was Covid-positive. I expect to have doors slammed in my face. Yet, everyone is perfectly courteous to the Mail.  One shop lends me a pair of skis for a few hours and refuses payment. There is even a welcome at the infamous Kitzloch bar.  I imagined I would find the place boarded up or, at least, renamed. Instead, builders are working on a new terrace extension ahead of next month's planned reopening.  Blame game: Robert outside Kitzloch. My arrival comes just before the current temporary travel ban on the British  Manager Bernhard Zangerl, 26, explains that his family - who have lived and farmed here for generations - had bought the Kitzloch only at the start of last season. He insists they have nothing to hide as he talks me through the most challenging few days of all their lives. 'All the time, we did exactly what we were told to do,' says Bernhard. 'There were mistakes by the authorities, sure, but people were making mistakes all over the world.'  It was on March 5, that the Ischgl tourist office called to say that several people in Iceland had gone down with the virus after partying in the Kitzloch a few days earlier. Attention switched to a German bartender, now known as Patient Zero, who had been off sick for two days. When he turned out to be positive, all the staff - including Bernhard - were sent into quarantine and tested.  'The authorities said that if we got new staff and disinfected the bar, we could reopen,' says Bernhard. Two days later, he learned that he and 15 other front-of-house staff were positive (those in the kitchen were not). 'That was when we became the first bar in Europe to shut down.'  Bernhard insists many myths have evolved - that the Kitzloch was a wild party den; that he and others had knowingly worked while infected. Not so, he insists.  'This was just a traditional apr√®s ski place with music from 3pm to 7pm and then restaurant service from 8pm to 11pm.'  He says that things would get lively, but no more raucous than a boozy chorus of Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline or Danish drinking songs. 'We had a lot of Scandinavian customers.'  Former guests, however, report that the place was so noisy that staff would communicate via football whistles.  One Danish guest recalls a waitress wandering past with a tray of 100 shots. It's safe to say I am not in Michelin-star territory. Bernhard says he wishes all those involved in the legal action well. But he is looking ahead.  The Kitzloch can operate as a sit-down restaurant once the Austrian government allows hospitality to resume, although apr√®s-ski bars remain banned. Patient Zero (whom Bernhard won't name) has since emigrated to Canada.  All the other staff, however, want to come back, including a Swiss waitress who featured in some press reports as another 'super-spreader'. 'She had previously been ill with something different, so everyone said: 'It must be Covid,' ' says Bernhard.  He believes it would be a mistake for the Kitzloch to rebrand itself and that the loyal clientele will return. 'Most people understand it was not our fault,' he says.  So does he regret buying the Kitzloch? 'No, at least the worst season was the first!'  Dr Kolba, the Vienna-based lawyer for the infected skiers, says that the legal process against the authorities has barely begun.  His first test case will be a claim for 100,000 euros on behalf of an Austrian woman whose husband died after catching the virus in Ischgl. He tells me it is 'crazy' that the state is already preparing to reopen resorts.  'They have learned nothing and it could happen all over again,' he tells me. 'But the tourism industry is very powerful.'  Of all the Alpine nations, Austria is most reliant on winter sports. In the Tyrol region alone, one job in three involves tourism. Overall, it accounts for 15 per cent of GDP.  I drive a couple of hours to another famous Tyrolean town much-loved by the British. Kitzbhel will celebrate its 750th birthday this year, however much Covid tries to wreck the party.  'A ski holiday here is safer than staying in London,' says Dr Christian Harisch, chairman of the Kitzbhel Tourist Board and owner of several leading hotels in the town.  He believes the town can still salvage this ski season by reducing the number of people in each cable car, improving ventilation and registering all restaurant diners.  Above all, he believes in rapid testing. 'Here's my test result from earlier this morning,' he says, handing me a plastic strip.  Whereupon he rips open a swab, leans back and proceeds to poke his nose and throat all over again for my benefit.  It's a curious sight to behold at a boardroom table, but, five minutes later, it's another negative.  'These are certified tests costing 5 euros each,' he says. 'The staff are all tested and our guests can have one every day if they want. Have one with your breakfast!'  He is furious Switzerland is stealing a march on everyone else, pointing to the Swiss resort of St Moritz. 'They have a worse infection rate and St Moritz hotels are 100 per cent full,' he says.  'We have a lower rate and yet we are 100 per cent empty.'  So where does this leave the British skier? For the moment, a trip to Europe is not an option.  But industry veterans, such as James Palmer-Tomkinson, of PT Ski, a well-known British company in the Swiss resort of Klosters, expects demand to rocket later in the season when current glitches are sorted out.  Peter Hardy, ski writer and editor of Welove2ski.com, says many of the higher resorts will want to extend their season into May, snow permitting. For now, I can report that, here at Covid Ground Zero, it is pure Good King Wenceslas - deep and crisp and even.  Unfortunately, at present, the only Brit on the mountain is me.","fever, cough",,,,,,,,
